== Preface.

After some hesitation,
I am induced to adopt a mode of narrative as that
whereby alone the attention of the young can be engaged,
or their hearts interested;
and the heart it is of the utmost importance for the instructor to secure on his side;
nothing being more certain,
than that we never really improve in our moral state but by the operation
of those influences which engage the affections on the side of virtue.

I have therefore endeavoured, in this little work, to appeal to the feelings,
and especially such as are of a tender and humbling kind, these being, as I conceive,
best fitted to awaken the deep and touching sensibilities, which,
as they form the loveliest,
form also the truest link of connection between the helpless creature
and the all-powerful and compassionate Creator.
