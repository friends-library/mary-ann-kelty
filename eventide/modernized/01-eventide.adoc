And Isaac went out to meditate in the field at eventide.

== Advertisement to the Reader

It may be thought perhaps, by some persons, that there is an abundance of practical,
and too little of doctrinal statement in these pages; but if so,
the Author can only reply,
that her personal teaching through a long and deep experience in the ways of God,
has been so continuously of a spiritual and practical kind,
that she could only follow it as her guide in attempting to influence other minds.
If she ventures to add,
that she believes there is too much attention in the present day given to doctrine,
and too little to practice in the religious world,
she cannot but think she will be well understood, and sympathized with,
by many of its members.

[quote.scripture, , Psalm 104:34]
____
My meditation of him shall be sweet; I will be glad in the Lord.
____

There is an outward world of bustle and activity where things
lie upon the surface to be judged of by the senses;
and there is an inner world where things are shrouded in silence and invisibility,
to be considered by the spirit.

We belong to both worlds; but our real being is lived out in the secret and silent one.
There, like the trees and plants, our root is fixed; and from it, we,
like them develop fruits, flowers, or profitless weeds.
"`If the root be holy so are the branches.`"
But care must be taken to water this root, or it will produce only the sour,
crude vintage of wild grapes.

Reading and prayer are right means of culture; but meditation must be united to them,
or they will be nearly useless.
Any time that affords due leisure and tranquillity for such an exercise may be chosen;
but it seems to be especially desirable at the close of day.
With serene hope of good, let us then draw near in these pages to the Father of Spirits,
and may He meet us with His blessing, and rendering our meditations of Him sweet,
cause us to be glad in the Lord!

[quote.scripture, , Isaiah 60:18]
____
Violence shall no more be heard in your land;
wasting nor destruction within your borders; but you shall call your walls Salvation,
and your gates Praise.
____

There are two besetting sins commonly found in company in the unregenerate mind--namely,
violence and waste.
The fierceness and prodigality of the fleshly nature
instinctively manifests itself in a vehement,
sudden, and profuse way.
Now this, now that start of will and wish is caught at, and pursued,
much as children of smaller growth catch at, and hunt a butterfly.
But where the Spirit of the Lord leads the human being, all is gentle, orderly,
and economical; means being justly adapted to ends,
and both used in the service of truth.

The teaching of this holy Instructor points always to an abstinence from all rash, rough,
unprepared movements and measures.
It calls to a holy fast from such things,
and a loosening of the will from adhering to them.
Its language in the mouth of the prophet is, "`Is not this the fast that I have chosen:
to loose the bands of wickedness, to undo the heavy burdens,
and to let the oppressed (the grieved Spirit of the Lord in your conscience) go free:
and that you break every yoke`" Isaiah 58:6. That is,
that you forcibly detach yourselves from being yoked in bondage to sin, self, and Satan.

=== III

[quote.scripture, , Isaiah 9:10]
____
The bricks are fallen down, but we will build with hewn stones;
the sycamores are cut down, but we will change them into cedars.
____

This is the language of "`pride and stoutness of
heart:`" the assertion of self-will crossed,
but not corrected, disappointed, but not daunted, arrested,
but not restrained in its forth-rushing determination to carry out its purposes.

It behooves us to watch and war firmly and constantly
against yielding to this strong and dangerous spirit,
which is, in a measure, inherent in every human being,
and sure to be predominant in those who, from their energy and force of character,
are the most likely to be active in forming and executing crude and ill considered enterprises.
It befits sincerely religious persons to receive
with lowliest subjection of will and wish,
all such checks to their designs as bear the slightest
indication of rebuke for forming them.
"`God speaks once, yes twice, but man regards it not.`"
How often does He speak in the silent force of circumstances,
especially when they constrain us to forego a cherished purpose!

=== IV

[quote.scripture, , Ezekiel 1:21]
____
The spirit of the living creature was in the wheels.
____

Growth is the test of healthy life;
and that which it behooves us to promote in our spiritual being.
To this end, the soul should be in a state of perpetual progress.
Never therefore, stop to gaze either backwards or forwards.
Mere philosophical thinkers have discovered the futility of this.

"`The present only,`" says Hobbes, "`has a being in nature.
Things past have a being in memory; but things to come have no being at all.`"

Our business is to unite ourselves with the great I AM--the perpetual Now;
and with Nature, as renewed and advanced every moment by his hand.
Let us yield ourselves to him and his working as the plants and flowers of the field do.
"`Onward, and still onward,`" should be our watch-word,
for the spirit of our life is in these wheels that send us forward in the will of God.
But these stand sometimes: then you must stand with them; but be sure of this,
that you are none the less growing and advancing in the heavenly
life when you obey the holy will which commands you to be passive,
and cease awhile from going forward in what seemed your prescribed
course--"`They also serve who only stand and wait.`"^
footnote:[Milton]

=== V

[quote.scripture, , Isaiah 33:18]
____
Where is the scribe?
Where is the receiver?
Where is he that counted the towers?
____

To have something to fall back upon as a source of enjoyment, or of hope and consolation,
is the great object of human life;
and hence it was the remark of our great moralist Dr. Johnson, that,
"`in order to be happy, we must always have something in view.`"
Nature is forever intent upon "`counting its towers;`" or,
in less figurative language we may say,
that it is always hunting amidst the objects of time and
sense for something on which to expend its affections.
But what it gathers in these regions, is, for the most part, unstable and unsatisfying.
Something which _endures,_ is the matter to obtain.
This must be truth;--for nothing else possesses within it the elements of immortality.
But Pilate`'s question still presents itself, and the restless spirit asks as he did,
"`What is truth?`"

That is truth my friend (at least that particular portion of it which practically
concerns you) which leads you to keep your attention fixed upon the present moment,
and to _stand_ in that moment as a sentinel on his post, watching for,
and receiving the order of his Lord and Master concerning
it,--whether it be to do,--to suffer,--or to enjoy.

=== VI

[quote.scripture, , Romans 15:13]
____
Now the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing,
that you may abound in hope through the power of the Holy Spirit.
____

There is much delight in the exercise of hope.
The mind of man is so far constituted like his body,
that it possesses a capacity for hunger, and a necessity for eating;
and such is the overpowering strength of its appetite,
that when destitute of any present supply of food,
it turns back to satiate itself with the bones and ashes of dead scenes and circumstances.
No process is more unwholesome than this "`chewing
the cud of sweet and bitter fancies;`" though,
with imaginative persons, none is more common.
Hence the holy command "`eat that which is good.`"
Nothing is so good and natural for the soul, even as mother`'s milk to the babe,
as an object of hope to feed upon; only take care that it is a nourishing and good hope.
To long for,--to seek after, and to expect to find, the knowledge of God,
and larger experience of his ways of leading,
and dealing with our souls,--presents a blessed object of hope to our notice.
All that is needed to possess and make it abidingly ours,
is faith in "`the power of the Holy Spirit`" to fill us with "`joy and peace in believing`"
that this divine hope may be experienced by us in an abounding measure.

=== VII

[quote.scripture, , Job 22:21-22]
____
Acquaint now yourself with him, and be at peace: thereby good shall come unto you.
Receive, I pray you, the law from his mouth, and lay up his words in your heart.
____

In the solitude of the mind--in that interior world where we only are,
and only ever can be happy or miserable,
how essential is it that we should feel ourselves in connection with something
which manifests itself as a sympathising Guide and Ruler.
"`You have this,`" the merely rational man would say, "`in the gift of reason.`"

But he would not say what was true.
We have, to a certain extent, a Guide in Reason; but it is a cold and rigid director.
It is no comforter,--no sympathiser,--no divine counsellor.

The Creator alone, who "`knows whereof we are made,
and remembers that we are but dust,`" is the all sufficient helper of his creatures.
Seek therefore acquaintance with him,
by waiting and watching for the pointings of that righteous law which he has
promised to put into our hearts,--"`that we may not sin against him.`"

=== VIII

[quote.scripture, , Psalm 24:3-4]
____
Who shall ascend into the hill of the Lord?
Or who shall stand in his holy place?
He that has clean hands and a pure heart; who has not lifted up his soul unto vanity,
nor sworn deceitfully.
____

A simple, pure, and humble heart is indispensable to the knowledge of God,
and the enjoyment of His presence.
Great interior watchfulness is necessary in order to bring it into this state;
and above all things it is essential to hold in check the secret, subtle,
and most frequent workings of vanity.
It is perfectly inconceivable,
till we set ourselves to the task of observing and "`keeping our hearts
with all diligence,`" how the "`lifting up the soul`" with self-love,
and self-exaltation, mixes with almost every one of our thoughts, purposes, and desires.

What dreams and dramas,
all in favour of self,--all tending to the glorification of this great hero,
will insensibly engage our imaginations, unless instantly rejected with calm contempt,
as the light from the Spirit of Truth reveals them to us!
Precious indeed, is the breathing of the renewed soul,
speaking in the Psalmist`'s prayer, "`turn away my eyes from looking at worthless things,
and revive me in your way.`"

=== IX

[quote.scripture, , Job 36:8-9]
____
And if they be bound in fetters and be held in cords of affliction,
then he shows them their work, and their transgressions that they have exceeded.
____

None but He who made the heart can search its mysterious depths,
and reveal the deceit and iniquity which it harbours.
And how does he effect this salutary discovery--and when?

At that propitious season which favours the sowing of good seed in the soul;
that is to say, when the wild, ignorant,
covetous will of the flesh "`is bound in fetters,
and held in cords of affliction`"--then is God`'s time to show unto the foolish,
erring creature, his transgressions in which he has exceeded;
and by this revelation he also shows the way of humiliation
in which the soul is to be healed.

Hearken diligently to this divine Physician; and watch as for your life,
for His sacred revelations.
Humble yourself before the disclosures they make of manifold dangerous excesses.
"`O, how graphic, how just,`" the penitent soul exclaims,
"`is this scriptural expression of my condition--my transgressions,
in which I have exceeded--excessive pride, excessive vanity,
excessive self-love in all things, and at all times!
Lord cleanse!
Lord pardon!`"

=== X

[quote.scripture, , Jeremiah 33:6]
____
Behold I will bring it health and cure, and I will cure them,
and will reveal unto them the abundance of peace and truth.
____

It is the presence of sin which causes the variety of moral
diseases that render the whole world in a spiritual sense,
one vast lazar-house.
Things are false, and yet they are contemplated as true;
hence there can result nothing to the deceived creature but the interior
tossings and tumults which belong to the confusion of an unhealthy mind.
There is only one physician of value to turn to in this state;
and that is the Holy Spirit of Truth.
Feel His presence, or, at all events, "`_grope for it,_ in the hope that you may find it,
seeing that He is not far from each one of us.`"

Be assured that as it is His purpose, so it is His delight,
to "`bring unto you health and cure.`"
But you must submit to His mode of treatment,
and lie quite passive and patient in His hands.

"`Peace and truth`" are not things to be learned and held in your head as a mere notion.
They describe a spiritual condition of health and renovation;
and are to be received into your moral constitution as new life--new being,
and can only be so received through the death of the old diseased life.

=== XI

[quote.scripture, , Romans 7:25]
____
With the mind I myself serve the law of God; but with the flesh the law of sin.
____

[quote.scripture, , Romans 8:2]
____
For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus,
has made me free from the law of sin and death.
____

All things act under the law of their nature;
and it is a vast help towards the attainment of a
firm abiding faith and confidence in God,
to be fully persuaded of this great truth.

You never find people doubtful or disputatious about the laws of arithmetic,
because they are well understood to be fixed and unalterable;
and it would be considered mere folly to argue about their results.
Just as sure, though not so demonstrable, is the law of God;
that law which the Apostle said that he "`served with his mind,`"
and which he so truly calls the law of the Spirit of life;
thus distinguishing it as the power which was to dethrone
and set him free from the law of sin and death;
that ignoble law of the flesh which he shared with the beasts that perish,
and which he served,
whenever he enlisted himself under the command of his carnal nature and its desires.

=== XII

[quote.scripture, , Psalm 5:8]
____
Lead me, O Lord, in your righteousness because of my enemies;
make your way straight before my face.
____

"`Because of my enemies,`" said the holy psalmist;
deeply taught by the illumination of the Holy Spirit, and also by severe experience,
to perceive and understand the number and the nature of his spiritual foes.
"`Because of my enemies;`"--because I am helpless to see, and impotent to escape from,
the snares of those that lay wait for my soul, "`lead me O Lord in your righteousness,
and make your way straight before my face!`"
O my soul, let this be your daily prayer; and watch thereunto with all perseverance.
Let not your words go up "`as the morning dew that quickly
passes away;`" but remember them in the moment of temptation,
when those enemies are near and active, whom you have so much cause to dread,
and against whom, in vain will you draw upon any wisdom and strength of your own.
It is the righteousness of God, as implanted within you by his Spirit,
and making your path the straight line of rectitude,
which alone can redeem you from their destruction.

=== XIII

[quote.scripture, , John 8:12]
____
I am the Light of the world: he that follows me shall not walk in darkness,
but shall have the light of life.
____

[quote.scripture, , John 12:36]
____
While you have light, believe in the light, that you may be the children of light.
____

It clears the way in all religious difficulties,
to have a definite conception of the object of our faith.
The proper object of a christian`'s belief, is "`Christ in him,
the hope of glory;`"--that is to say, Christ by his Spirit, shining upon,
and enlightening his path through the darkness of the world, the flesh,
and the devil--is the distinct, well-understood object,
felt to be living and acting in him which he worships, and aims to obey.
Turn your attention to his light shining in your conscience; mind that, believe in that,
yield your will up to that; obey its suggestions; submit to its reproofs;
and let it at all times, be your leader and guide,
and you will soon be able to say "`I _know_ in whom I have believed;`"
"`I _know_ that my Redeemer lives,`" and I _know_ this is no notion
picked out of the letter of scripture which I possess,
but a full realization of the promise so often repeated in the old Testament,
"`they shall know the Lord.`"

=== XIV

[quote.scripture, , Matthew 7:14]
____
Strait is the gate, and narrow is the way which leads unto life,
and few there be that find it.
____

It is one thing to study and to understand religious doctrine,
and another to apply it to practice;
but the test of reality in our condition as professed believers,
lies wholly in the practical part of it.
In the text above quoted,
we may find an infallible rule whereby to try and examine ourselves,
and as the apostle says, to "`prove our own selves,`" whether or not we be in the faith.
Probe the matter therefore with such questions as these:

"`Do I find the entrance into life strait, and its way narrow?
Do I experience every day, or, at least, very often,
interior struggles for deliverance from the sin and willfulness of my fleshly nature?
Am I sensible of any strife,--any contrariety between my carnal and my spiritual nature?
Do I, in fact, know with perfect certainty,
that I have these two natures of flesh and spirit within me,
and that one is in perpetual antagonism to the other?`"

Out of nothing,--nothing can come; and quite certain is it,
that if we know nothing of straitness and narrowness,
and opposition in the path in which we are travelling,
it cannot be the way that leads to everlasting life.

=== XV

[quote.scripture, , Psalm 15:1-2]
____
Lord, who shall abide in your tabernacle?
Who shall dwell in your holy hill?
He that walks uprightly and works righteousness, and speaks the truth in his heart.
____

O, my soul, take home this sacred lesson for your comfort and encouragement!
You may be of small account with the world,
and possess but little wherewith to swell a triumph there;
and whatever you have of true light and knowledge will prompt you to reply, "`the less,
the better.`"
But you must possess and call, your own, _one thing,_ or,
you are wretched indeed,--and poor with the poorest poverty.
You must have a habitation,--a home,--a resting place for your
mind;--and you must have a companion there to speak peace to you
in "`the wilderness and solitary place`" of your strange,
mysterious, inner world; and who can this be,
but He who knows that world,--and who alone can rightly rule in, and regulate, and guide,
and correct, and counsel and comfort the inhabitant of it?
Most wise and natural therefore, is the query, "`Lord,
who shall abide in your tabernacle?`"--in that tent in my spirit which belongs to You;
remember the answer,--and make it your aim "`to walk uprightly,--to
work righteousness,--and speak the truth in your heart.`"

=== XVI

[quote.scripture, , 1 Samuel 15:22]
____
To obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams.
____

It is remarkable how much is said in the Scriptures, especially of the old Testament,
upon the duty of _hearkening;_
and it is equally remarkable how little attention is paid to it.
In fact we may venture to believe,
that but very few persons have the least idea of what it really means.
Well, and what does it mean?
I would simply answer that it means waiting upon God.
If this should equally require to be explained,
I will give the explanation in the words of an able divine of the seventeenth century.

[quote]
____
Waiting upon God must needs be exercised in denying self both inwardly and outwardly;
and coming to a still,
meek dependence upon God by abstracting the mind from all its own workings, imaginations,
and speculations.
The soul being thus cleansed and emptied,
the little seed of righteousness which God has sown in it,
and which is burdened by man`'s natural thoughts and imaginations,
finds space and power to arise,
and to become that divine birth by which man`'s soul is leavened,
and by abiding in which he comes to be accepted of God, to stand in his presence,
to hear his voice, and understand the motions of his Holy Spirit.
____

=== XVII

[quote.scripture, , Luke 21:19]
____
In your patience possess your souls.
____

Comfort and joy are great blessings;
but they are administered rather as cordials to cheer
and strengthen us in our toilsome journey,
than as food which we are to live upon.

The will of God concerning us, which "`is our sanctification,`" is to be our daily bread;
and patience mixes largely in this nourishment.
And, as all holy truths are linked together in beautiful harmony, we shall surely find,
that as we grow in the ability of possessing our souls in patience,
we are growing also in every other gift and grace of the Holy Spirit,
and are becoming acceptable in the sight of our great Master,
who can only love us in proportion as we are made lovely by the workmanship of his grace.
Hence, how sweet is the joy of the renewed soul thus made fit for her Lord`'s approval!
Listen to her language: "`I will greatly rejoice in the Lord,
my soul shall be joyful in my God; for he has clothed me with the garments of salvation,
he has covered me with the robe of righteousness,
as a bridegroom decks himself with ornaments,
and as a bride adorns herself with her jewels`" Isaiah 61:10.

=== XVIII

[quote.scripture, , Psalm 119:36]
____
Incline my heart unto your testimonies, and not to covetousness.
____

There are two things to be observed in this scripture, one, as something to be sought,
the other, as something to be shunned.

"`Incline my heart unto your testimonies.`"
What "`testimonies?`"
"`The scriptures,`" would be the reply of most persons.

But what scriptures could David refer to in this petition,
seeing that most of the scriptures as we have them were then unwritten?
The scriptures may speak of these testimonies,
and point the soul to the observance of them,
but the testimonies themselves are another and a more living thing than any written rule.
They are the gleams of light from the Spirit of Truth
which shine upon the path of the just,
and which, without speech or language, indicate the way in which the believer is to go.

"`Your testimonies are wonderful,`" says the psalmist,
"`therefore does my soul keep them.`"
He knew their wisdom and value,
and could sincerely pray that his heart might be inclined unto them.

Equally wise and needful is his other supplication to be delivered from covetousness;
that all-devouring desire of self-appropriation, which, from the cradle to the grave,
works the destruction of the creature`'s moral good and peace.

=== XIX

[quote.scripture, , Isaiah 65:4]
____
Which remain among the graves, and lodge in the monuments; which eat swine`'s flesh,
and broth of abominable things is in their vessels.
____

The whole work of the Spirit of God upon the soul is regeneration.
His language is "`behold I make all things _new._`"
"`If any man be in Christ he is a _new_ creature; old things are passed away,
and all things are become _new._`"
Nevertheless, in the unregenerate part of us,
there is a perpetual return to these "`old things,`"
figuratively alluded to in the language of the prophet,
"`as remaining among the graves,`" etc.

The imagination and the thoughts linger over dead remembrances,
and recur to scenes and circumstances which were once pleasing,
or interesting in any way.

But this is a very unhealthy indulgence.
"`You shall not eat that which dies of itself.`"
Things die a natural death when they have done their work,
and no more serve as proper nourishment for the mind to feed upon;
and in turning to them for that purpose, we "`eat swine`'s flesh,
and broth of abominable things.`"

=== XX

[quote.scripture, , 1 Peter 1:14]
____
As obedient children,
not fashioning yourselves according to the former lusts in your ignorance.
____

There is much divine light and instruction to be derived from this scripture: and first,
let us observe the term of "`obedient children.`"
What a scope of tenderness and endearment it comprises!
We are to be as docile children: God`'s obedient and good children.
Does the wise man of the world and the philosopher smile disdainfully at such an idea?
God`'s child can bear it.

Not "`fashioning yourselves according to the former lusts in your ignorance.`"

It is to be observed,
that the habits and desires of the will insensibly mold us into their own nature;
so that we are inwardly fashioned into something comely or deformed,
just as the prevailing tone of our affections is holy or impure.
How lovely in the sight of God, may, under this aspect of things,
be many a countenance and form wasted with sickness and infirmity,
and which man recoils from;
and how loathsome many that he is ready to worship!--at the last,
when the husk of the flesh drops off, this will be understood.
And of the wicked,
what will be the Lord`'s judgment?--"`as a dream when one
awakes,`" so shall he then "`despise their image.`"

=== XXI

[quote.scripture, , Hebrews 11:1]
____
Faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.
____

How are we to obtain this faith?
This query seems to introduce another--namely, what is faith?

The text above quoted tells us that it consists of substance and evidence.
"`I will cause those that love me to inherit substance`"--is
a precious promise to the believer;
and faith is a part of the substance spoken of.
Trust and confidence in good things to come, is one of its characteristics,
and "`the evidence of things not seen`" is another.
This is a remarkable expression, "`the evidence of things not seen.`"
When have I this evidence; and what does it consist of?
I can see at a glance,
what is meant by "`things hoped for`"--but this "`evidence
of things not seen,`" goes beyond future blessings.
It seems to point to some immediate good which is _now,_ at this present moment to be mine.
Through the power and nature of faith no doubt it does.
Faith in the indwelling of the Holy Spirit as revealing the will of God to the soul,
bestows an "`evidence of things not seen,`" which
enriches it with substantial blessings ever present,
and ever recognised as near and real.

=== XXII

[quote.scripture, , Psalm 36:8]
____
You shall make them drink of the river of your pleasures.
____

Nothing really gladdens the heart of the human being with healthy and enduring joy,
but a sensible experience of goodness.
We may be pleased in a high degree with such things as gratify our self-love.
An accession of wealth, or fame, or honour,
may impart vast elevation to our animal spirits;
but not add an iota to our genuine capacity for joy.
To reach to this, there must be some higher feelings touched than those of self-love.
We must be made to see the glory and beauty of the Divine Nature,
and of the emotions which bring us into unity with it.

All soft, compassionate, loving, meek, pure aspirations of heart,
have in them something of the nature of God; and which,
to speak of them in the figurative language before us, cause our souls, as it were,
to drink of the river of those pleasures which are at the right hand of God forevermore,
and of which His Holy Spirit is the minister.
Most carefully should we aim to dwell under a sense of the presence of this divine guest;
and spread out our souls to drink in the heavenly
dew of his meekening and purifying influences.

=== XXIII

[quote.scripture, , Isaiah 22:2]
____
You who are full of noise, a tumultuous city, a joyous city.
____

One of the hardest tasks, and that which requires the greatest of the mind`'s efforts,
is for it to be still; but the first step to the knowledge of ourselves,
and one which comprizes in it the first step to the knowledge of divine truth,
consists in controlling the restlessness of nature.

It is, in fact, as good policy, as it is sound piety, to inure our souls to tediousness,
dryness, and monotony in the circumstances of life;
for it is chiefly through all this contrariety to the will of the flesh,
that the dominion of truth is established in the mind.
We are told that "`tribulation works patience;`" that is to say,
the opposition which trial gives to our desires, works,
or forms the meek and lovely temper called patience; and then,
as holy scripture proceeds to inform us, patience produces experience; or in other words,
a living, abiding knowledge of God, and his way of acting with the soul,
and a sweet certainty that he is educating and caring for it,
and preparing it for himself;
none of which divine truths can be learned but through quietness of mind.

=== XXIV

[quote.scripture, , Ezekiel 1:20]
____
Wherever the spirit was to go, they went.
____

We read a great deal in the Bible about "`the way of the
Lord,`" and it is a great matter to understand what it means.
The scriptures tell us much respecting its nature and purpose; as, for instance,
that it "`is strength to the upright, that it is a perfect way,
that it is the way that leads unto life,`" etc.
But information is not experience; and it is not by reading words about it,
even though they be true words,
that will make us understand the power of the thing itself.
In order to arrive at the experience of this,
we must observe and obey its dictates in our own hearts; so that wherever it leads,
we are ready to follow.

To prepare us for this obedience, we must silence the motions of our own spirits,
and thus open a way in the desert of our souls for the entrance of the Divine Spirit;
for, of this we may rest assured,
that no gleam of heavenly light can reveal to us the way of the Lord,
until we have ceased from the workings of our own will and way.
"`Cease to do evil,`" precedes the precept of "`learn to do good.`"

=== XXV

[quote.scripture, , 2 Cor. 10:4-5]
____
For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal,
but mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds; casting down imaginations,
and every high thing that exalts itself against the knowledge of God,
and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ.
____

The "`casting down imaginations,`" and bringing into
captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ,
is the great practical work of religion.
Once let it be well understood, and firmly undertaken and persevered in,
and the ground is secure on which we may build a
habitation of peace and rest for our souls.
For it is with the thoughts and imaginations, that the real business of life proceeds.
Here, the purpose is conceived and planned, which is to end in happiness or misery.
Here, the will, and the desires and affections of our nature unrestrained,
work more often than not, our great loss and error, not to say, sin.
Thoughts are admitted which ought to have been cast down,
and vain imaginations grow into strongholds of iniquity which make us prisoners to Satan.
How all important is it then,
that we possess ourselves of the weapons adapted to the
warfare which is to end in the captivity of these foes.

[quote.scripture, , Deuteronomy 33:27]
____
The eternal God is your refuge, and underneath are the everlasting arms;
and he shall thrust out the enemy from before you, and shall say, destroy them.
____

To a heart which the grace of God has softened, it is sweet and affecting to reflect,
that even in this world which "`lies in wickedness,`" even in this scene of fearful evil,
there have been, and there still are, some who can trust in God,
and who have been able even to die for His Truth`'s sake.
One cannot but pause and ask how this is?

How comes it, that,
while to the greater part of human beings the idea of God
is merely that of the letters which compose His name,
there are persons who have become acquainted with Him, who hold communion with Him,
who pray to Him for light and teaching,
and who are persuaded that their destiny is wholly in His hands?
Well, this happens simply by their putting faith in His promises.
Such a one as this for instance, at the head of this page,
is full of light and life to them.
They believe that their Creator is the eternal God,
and that His everlasting arms do enfold them in an embrace of love and pity;
and that to every one of their spiritual foes, He gives them strength to rise superior;
and says unto their souls "`destroy them.`"

[quote.scripture, , Psalm 147:15]
____
His word runs very swiftly.
____

When a sudden view of a subject, hitherto obscure, visits the mind,
how common is the expression "`it struck me.`"
These glances of light reveal more than a thousand words;
but we usually lose their concise and valuable revelations
from yielding to the prurient curiosity of the fleshly mind,
which always wants to know more than is given it to know.
Reverently observe and obey the rapid gleams of the Spirit of life;
but never presume to question them.
The childlike spirit to which God vouchsafes His illuminations,
does not reason or inquire; it simply receives and obeys.
For, let it be firmly believed, that the holy Word which guides and enlightens the soul,
does not stop to be argued with.
It reveals the way, that is, it makes duty manifest;
"`and whatsoever does make manifest is light.`"
Light,
the swiftest--the purest--the most penetrating of all things--__this__ is the true teacher;
and from His teachings there is no appeal.

[quote.scripture, , Malachi 3:2]
____
But who may abide the day of his coming, and who shall stand when he appears?
For he is like a refiner`'s fire, and like fullers`' soap.
____

One of the most painful of religious duties is that of quietly submitting
to be stripped of everything which nature most loves and longs to keep;
yet without it, all is but "`sounding brass and a tinkling cymbal.`"
The old building must be so pulled down, that not one stone is left upon another.
Thoughts, desires, and remembrances, all the progeny of the old Adam,
must be slain without pity; that those things which cannot be slain or shaken,
may remain.
Therefore, if we would be progressing and growing in the new nature,
there must be sensibly felt a pruning and excision of old things,
through the power of the Holy Spirit.
Every day some anguish must be endured from the wounds which grace gives to sin;
for "`these are contrary the one to the other,`" and will be ever in a state of warfare;
and where there is warfare, there will be wounds and death; and where these are,
there must of necessity be pain.
Depend upon it, that if there are no pangs felt, there is no progress;
none of the true baptism of the Holy Spirit, and of fire, going on in the soul.

=== XXIX

[quote.scripture, , Proverbs 28:5]
____
Evil men understand not judgment: but they that seek the Lord understand all things.
____

It is instructive, though painful to observe,
the total ignorance of many of the most intellectual and learned persons,
respecting the ways and dealings of God.
They know nothing of themselves as connected with Him,
nor of the judgment he may pass upon their thoughts, desires, and purposes.
"`They understand not judgment`"--and are destitute of all comprehension
of the true nature of things in a moral point of view.
This astonishing ignorance is simply the result of lack of faith.

"`They that seek the Lord understand all things.`"
Why? Because they believe in Him;
and the smallest measure of faith brings a divinely illuminating power with it;
and a power not confined to the single subject which may be before us,
but which runs through a glorious chain of truths;
so that it is perfectly true that "`they that seek the Lord understand all things.`"
"`When the heart is simple and teachable,`" says a spiritual writer,
"`it renders the soul simple, clear, and altogether abstracted from created things,
and divine wisdom sweetly draws, and actuates, and enlightens it.`"

[quote.scripture, , Isaiah 53:10-11]
____
It pleased the Lord to bruise him: when you shall make his soul an offering for sin,
he shall see his seed... He shall see of the travail of his soul and shall be satisfied;
by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many.
____

The incarnation of Christ was from the beginning of the world.
What soul, from the first man to the last,
would ever have found a ray of hope or strength to
do or to suffer according to the will of God,
or have drank one drop of divine consolation,
but from the union of his own nature with something superior to it?
Christ,
"`the power and the wisdom of God,`" was a willing
copartner with sinful and sorrowing humanity.
It was his precious mission of love to go in closest unity with the poor,
ruined creature through all his earthly vicissitudes.
Though despised and rejected by this ungrateful person, whom he humbles himself to serve,
still he keeps close to him--still he is ready and
"`mighty to save`"--still is he living with him,
suffering with him,
dying with him--"`tasting of death for every man,`"
and if the sinful creature will allow it,
redeeming him from the power of the grave, and rising with him to glory.

[quote.scripture, , Isaiah 46:4]
____
Even to your old age, I am he, and even to gray hairs I will carry you!
I have made, and I will bear; even I will carry, and will deliver you.
____

There is something very sweet and encouraging in remembering that it is the same God,
"`the Ancient of days,`" who took care of us at our birth,
and "`in whose book were all our members written
when as yet there was none of them,`" who ordains,
and will watch over all that pertains to our passage into another state of being.

"`I have made, and I will bear, and even to gray hairs will I carry you.`"

Precious promise!
Forever trust in it.
Dismiss all anxious fears,
all quailings of the fleshly mind in contemplating your transit to another state.
He who gave you your being, and appointed your place and condition in this life,
will not fail to be near you when you pass through the valley of the shadow of death.
He knows your feebleness, and, that without him,
you can not be otherwise than appalled at the thought of that stupendous passage.
But he that made you, will bear you through, and deliver you from all fear,
and all danger.

[quote.scripture, , 1 Kings 17:16]
____
And the barrel of meal wasted not, neither did the cruse of oil fail.
____

This was plain fare, but it lasted; and that is the great matter.
To set the habits and desires so that they shall last and not go out every now and then,
and leave the poor soul in darkness, is a great point.
"`You have taken away my gods,`" said Micah, "`and what have I more?`"
Take away the company, the pleasure parties, the running here and there,
and the perpetual feeding of the carnal mind upon the savoury food which it loves,
and what has it to fall back upon?
To learn to bear monotony, and to be contented with simple, humble things,
is the way to insure to ourselves something as near
to happiness as our human condition will admit of.
Learn therefore, to live low and to live uniformly.
There can be no peace without order;
and there can be no order in a life that is full of the excitements of pleasure.
Bear the hungering and wailing of nature after novelty.
It is the foolish, childish part that is active in such longings;
and this part you must calmly and silently renounce and disdain,
and cultivate that higher nature which can be patient, and which can bear to be denied,
and which thrives best in whatever tries its power of saying "`_no_`" to self-will.

=== XXXIII

[quote.scripture, , Psalm 119:32]
____
I will run the way of your commandments, when you shall enlarge my heart.
____

There is a straitness and contraction of mind in the unregenerate creature,
which renders him incapable of any cheerful or willing obedience towards God.
He endeavours, perhaps, to go in the way of the commandments of the Lord;
but he feels the yoke of them, and is too much embondaged by it,
to move swiftly and readily therein.

He may perform many good deeds, and assume with earnestness, and even sincere desire,
the semblance of a religious character; but,
until his heart is enlarged by the Spirit of life and liberty,
it is no true service that he renders,
but a forced and inwardly disliked representation of it.
Nor can it be otherwise;
since nothing is more certain than the word which tells
us that "`the carnal mind is not subject to the law of God;
neither indeed, can be.`"

We do but dress up an automaton, and cause it to work with machinery,
when we begin to act for God in our own strength,
and before we have earnestly sought the enlargement of heart which he who made it,
alone can bestow.

=== XXXIV

[quote.scripture, , Proverbs 27:21]
____
The refining pot is for silver and the furnace for gold,
and a man is valued by what others say of him.
____

Few things more clearly indicate to the sincere soul its real condition before God,
than the gleam of light, which, as by a glance, reveals every striving of self-idolatry.
There is an anecdote told of some preacher whose name I forget (I dare say _every_
preacher would endorse it as having happened to himself) that on being complimented,
when he came down from the pulpit, by a friend,
and told that he had preached with a power never known before, "`Ah,`" said he,
"`the devil said that to me before you did.`"

How often has the humiliating discovery to be made,
of the immense quantity of the dross of vanity which
mixes with and alloys the Lord`'s gold!
And as often as it is made, so often must the Holy Refiner`'s furnace consume it.

"`Never admit the thought of having done well`" says a spiritual writer,
"`but let everything pass into oblivion, by _letting go_ of that inexplicable feeling,
which, though perhaps involuntarily, nourishes the mind in its own complacency.`"^

[quote.scripture, , James 3:13]
____
Who is wise and understanding among you?
Let him show by good conduct that his works are done in the meekness of wisdom.
____

"`Meekness of wisdom!`"
The very words have a sweet subduing influence, and when dwelt upon in holy meditation,
lead the mind into a holy and spiritual frame; or, at all events,
they produce in it a tendency towards humility.

"`To think upon her (Wisdom) is perfection of wisdom;
and whosoever watches for her shall quickly be without care.`"^
footnote:[Wisdom of Solomon 6:15]

"`Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God,`" is the healing balm for all wounds.
Having then, the promise of this divine gift of wisdom,
"`let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and
of the spirit;`" and let us keep the king`'s highway of holiness,
whereon shall come "`no lion, nor any ravenous beast`" of the carnal mind;
but where the "`redeemed of the Lord shall walk`" in meekness, and purity,
and find sweet rest and peace unto their souls.

=== XXXVI

[quote.scripture, , Jeremiah 6:13]
____
From the least of them even unto the greatest of them, everyone is given to covetousness.
____

If we set ourselves to the task of watching attentively
over the thoughts and desires of our hearts,
(and let us remember that _here_ the work of religion begins) we
shall be quite astonished to perceive the uniformity and the pertinacity
with which they are employed in coveting something unpossessed.
To procure some sort of self-gratification, is the perpetual,
instinctive acting of the natural mind; and, but that from the aid of reason,
it embraces a wider and a higher scope,
this propensity to be ever seeking to feed self-love,
might be said to link the human being in very close affinity with the beasts that perish.
_They_ are always browsing and purveying for the indulgence of their appetites.
In like manner, the carnal mind is forever hunting after an object of enjoyment.
The toys of the baby are only changed for other toys
adapted for children of larger growth.
As in this state of covetousness, it is quite impossible that the soul should honour God,
by desiring, and delighting in the knowledge and service of Him,
slay as your worst of foes, all unruly longings, and all idolatries;^
footnote:[Covetousness which is idolatry Col 3:5]
and make it your aim at all times to "`be content with such things as you have.`"

=== XXXVII

[quote.scripture, , 2 Tim. 2:4]
____
No man that wars entangles himself with the affairs of this
life that he may please him who has chosen him to be a soldier.
____

It is of the utmost importance that we should endeavour to preserve
ourselves from all unnecessary contact with worldly matters;
for they have in their very nature, an entangling influence upon the mind,
which insensibly obscures its highest judgement,
and occasions much confusion in its perception of
the different affairs with which it mingles.
To draw the soul away from its centre,
and cause it to scatter its strength among the bewildering
multiplicities of such things as please the senses,
is the constant aim of the enemy of man; and if we would baffle him in his purposes,
we must stand like soldiers at our post,
in the attitude of those who watch and wait for the word of command;
which generally comes to us very gently,
and from the stillness and smallness of the voice that utters it almost imperceptibly,
except to the ear that is well trained by obedience to listen to it.

=== XXXVIII

[quote.scripture, , Eph. 6:10]
____
Be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might.
____

Some sincere persons, being deeply sensible of their weakness in withstanding temptation,
are prone to shelter themselves from danger by making vows and resolutions
to abstain from the sin which does most easily beset them.
This is generally trusting to a broken reed, and is not the right way of escape,
even if it be successful, for,
it places too much assumption of strength in the hands of the creature,
and is apt to lead him into unsafe confidence in the power of his own will.
Besides, it is only changing the _act,_ not the _nature_ of the agent that sins.
It is the same impetuous, fierce, determined will,
the same absolute _I_ which resolves as that which errs.
"`_I_ will never do this or the other wrong thing again.`"
But you _may,_ as stout as you are now in forswearing it.
Our only resource against sin is to cleave unto God,
as the Great Being who teaches our hands to war,
and our fingers to fight the good fight of faith;
and this is only done by adhering to a calm interior stillness, in which,
in a way quite hidden to human comprehension,
the soul grows in power to do and to suffer,
and advances in a capability of rising above itself,
till it becomes consciously and savingly, "`strong _in_ the Lord,
and in the power of _his_ might.`"

=== XXXIX

[quote.scripture, , Matthew 13:7]
____
And some fell among thorns, and the thorns sprung up and choked them.
____

It requires great watchfulness to avoid letting in
such thoughts and feelings into the mind as choke,
thicken, and impede its onward progress.
There is a tendency in the animal nature to "`chew
the cud`" of this and of the other fancy,
and to indulge in false feedings, and seek for false resting places wherein to dwell.

The constant aim of the soul that longs for purity and peace,
should be to _sit loose_ to earthly influences,
and to keep the spirit clear--simple--flowing--not stopped by the
puddles and mire of worldly things--not "`lading itself with its
own thick clay;`" but dropping away quietly--and steadily,
from every impediment that obstructs its passing on its appointed path.

"`The wellspring of wisdom is like a flowing brook.`"
This continual flowing, as of a peaceful, gentle river, is what should be,
and what certainly, in so far as the mind is under its influence, _would_ be, experienced,
in the presence of that wisdom which is from above.

=== XL

[quote.scripture, , Psalm 112:7]
____
He shall not be afraid of evil tidings, his heart is fixed, trusting in the Lord.
____

The vicissitudes with which human life is encompassed,
make it quite essential to our comfort,
that we should possess some interior stability or fixedness of mind.
Accustom yourself daily to feel a sure resting place for your spirit,
and observe what is the mental process which hinders, or which helps its establishment.
By persevering attention to what passes within you,
it will be easy for you to perceive what produces a brittle, hasty,
discomposed state of spirit.
You will also see that it is most commonly in your power
to prevent it by resolutely shutting the door upon the troops
of wandering thoughts which in our naturally unguarded state,
lead us captive to many foolish desires and imaginations.

"`For the bewitching of naughtiness does obscure things that are honest;
and the wandering of concupiscence does undermine the simple mind.`"^
footnote:[Wisdom of Solomon 4:12]
In this state of mental dispersion we are prepared for nothing; and consequently,
get scattered and broken to pieces by the first stroke of sorrow.
It is by standing upon the watch, and going softly,
that we are able to cultivate the calm, meek, unexcited temper,
which renders us fit to encounter in a proper spirit, either prosperity or adversity.

=== XLI

[quote.scripture, , Deut. 32:15]
____
You are waxen fat, you are grown thick, you are covered with fatness.
____

There is a strength and stubbornness of will in the unregenerate mind and all
its thoughts and purposes which may be described as rendering it thick and impure.
There is no clearness--no health in its doings; and we neither see where,
nor to what they tend, except indeed that it is to self-indulgence.

The habit which the undisciplined mind falls into, of running out after distant objects,
greatly promotes this turbid state of spirit.

It is a great matter to aim at living in the immediate moment,
and to avoid all interior doubts and reasonings,
which always have in them a tendency to produce a certain adhesiveness
that curdles and thickens the vehicle of the soul,
so that it can make no progress.
The order of God is perpetual growth, perpetual advancement.
"`Never hasting, but never resting,`"--it has been well observed,
is the law of all his glorious works; and would we but yield ourselves up to his law,
it would carry us on to the high perfection for which we were created.

=== The meek shall eat and be satisfied. Psalm 22:26

To be contented with things as they are, and to take things as they come,
is a simple way of learning to be happy.
But simple as it is, there are few who understand it.

The ravening nature of the fleshly mind is the robber and destroyer of all faith,
all confidence in God and His goodness.
The manna which He gives in the desert, in the small duties, and the small pleasures,
which fill the small moment with its appointed provender, the carnal mind ever did,
and ever will disdain.
It cannot therefore, "`eat and be satisfied`" with anything;
for it knows not the nature of real satisfaction.
It is the humble soul which aspires to little, and is satisfied with little,
that eats of what is good, and grows thereby.

O, it is a vast attainment in holy wisdom, to know how "`to go in and out,
and find pasture;`" and, when all created things are found to be nauseous,
that it may be said of those who love them,
"`they feed upon ashes,`" to eat the living bread and be satisfied.
Would you make this high attainment yours?
Be meek and lowly in heart; and take your little supply with gratitude,
as the Lord is pleased to deal it out to you, moment by moment.

=== XLIII

[quote.scripture, , John 15:4-5]
____
As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine,
no more can you except you abide in me... Without me, you can do nothing.
____

God gives to all His rational creatures the means of salvation
from evil--and they are found in that portion of divine light and
truth "`which gives light to every man coming into the world.`"
But this saving light must daily be waited upon, and watched for,
and the rebellious will of the natural man subjected to its dictates.
Worldly motives of self-interest may suffice to help
many persons to keep up an appearance of goodness,
and actually to refrain from the commission of outward sin;
but nothing can act upon the heart and affections so as
to cause the soul to love and delight in goodness,
but the light and grace of God.

Our own springs of virtue can only be grounded in that exalted
kind of self-love which teaches us that it is wiser and safer,
on the score of common sense, to be just and true, and well conducted, and moral,
than the reverse.
But something more than this is requisite to enable us to be radically good;
and this can only be obtained as we grow up like the branch into the true vine,
and draw the sap of His divine life into us.

=== XLIV

[quote.scripture, , Psalm 87:7]
____
All my springs are in you.
____

Commonly speaking, the most comprehensive and the most useful truths,
are the easiest to perceive and to understand.
They lie within our reach, and would be constantly available to us for our well being,
if we were sufficiently calm and self-possessed to observe and practise them.
But the thoughts of the fleshly mind are like "`the
eyes of the fool,`" spoken of by Solomon,
which "`are at the ends of the earth.`"

When once we have an assured faith that all our right
springs of action have their root in God,
we need have no solicitude about anything;
but simply waiting for the true light which comes with the moment`'s need and no sooner,
we may feel confident of divine guidance in every step we take,
and thus be always ready for everything; "`having our lamps burning, our loins girded,
and we ourselves like unto those that wait for their Lord.`"

No species of wisdom is so eminently useful,
so entirely of the kind "`which comes down from above,`"
as that which teaches us to _dwell_ in the present moment.
"`_Abide in me;_`" abide in the _now,_
the I AM. It is not to be imagined what light and truth this mode of living
one moment at a time will diffuse over the path of the individual,
nor how clearly it will enable him to discern that
"`all his springs`" are from the Fountain of Life.

=== XLV

[quote.scripture, , Romans 12:2]
____
Be not conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind,
that you may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect will of God.
____

It is the perpetual collision of the blind, stubborn, corrupt will of the creature,
with the good, acceptable, and perfect will of the Creator,
which fills the world with misery and confusion.
Nothing but a rectified will can deliver the human being from distress and danger;
and here we are told how it is to be accomplished.
"`Be not conformed to this world;`" be not led by
its artificial and conventional customs and laws;
neither be in subjection to any of its principles of action,
"`But be transformed by the renewing of your mind;`" that is by the daily,
sensible growth of new hopes, new views, new desires, and a new and holy life,
which operates as all life does, naturally, and simply, and instinctively.
In this renewed life, the will is so changed from its corrupt condition of self-hood,
that it can discern, and satisfactorily know, the will of God to be the only good,
acceptable, and perfect rule of life.

=== XLVI

[quote.scripture, , Matthew 7:13]
____
Strive to enter in at the strait gate.
____

The process of regeneration is one of pain and difficulty;
and the only sure test we can have that we are passing through it,
is our being sensible every day we live, of more or less of inward conflict,
and inward contrariety between the will of the old nature and that of the new.
For old things are not taken out of the way merely by wishing for their removal;
they must be cut off by the sword of the Spirit,
and a certain degree of pain must be felt as a testimony
that the work of slaying has passed upon them.

"`I kept silence but it was pain and grief unto me;
I became dumb and opened not my mouth.`"
This is the proper state, while this interior warfare is going on, and the wild,
Esau-like nature of the flesh is being brought into subjection
to the Lamb "`that takes away the sins of the world.`"
Feel then, the straitness of the path in which you are walking,
by accustoming yourself to endure unpleasant things;
and you will gradually perceive their immense value as means of humbling and
purifying your soul and causing you to become "`a new creature in Christ Jesus.`"

=== XLVII

[quote.scripture, , Psalm 46:10]
____
Be still, and know that I am God.
____

No lesson of a practical kind (and all lessons ought to
be practical) needs to be so often and so earnestly enforced,
as that of being inwardly calm and collected,
and waiting in silence before the Lord when we enter upon our devotional duties.
The mere effort after internal quietness and submission
produces a degree of healing and comfort to the soul;
for,
we _must_ suffer in some kind and measure before we are chastened and purified into the
state of spiritual obedience which renders us acceptable servants of the Lord;
and in whatever way this chastening is administered, we can only endure it profitably,
by being patient, cool, and lowly in heart.

"`The Lord is good to those that wait for him;`" and his goodness
is best shown in bringing us to that which brings us to Him.
This is invariably, affliction; for it is necessarily, something which opposes,
and therefore afflicts, the insatiable thirst of the will for its own gratification;
and in this affliction we are commanded to be still--for
the noblest of purposes,--even that we may know,
and love, and trust in God.

=== XLVIII

[quote.scripture, , Proverbs 23:26]
____
My son give me your heart; and let your eyes observe my ways.
____

It is true wisdom to take an observation as often as possible,
of the Spirit which is the leader of your life.
We know too well, if we know anything of ourselves, that there is very near to us,
a subtle and a tempting Spirit, ready to suggest, and to assist us in, evil doing.
But there is also a holy and wise Spirit quite as near,
and we can never spend too much time in waiting, and watching for, his motions.
"`Let your eyes observe my ways,`" is the precept of this ever present,
ever instructive Guide.
As if he had said, observe the difference between my ways and your own;
observe how continually I restrain and draw you back
from the outrushing purposes of your own will.
Observe how invariably I point you to quietness and submission under trials;
to strict integrity in your dealings with others,
and to purity and singleness of heart in your dealings
with yourself in the solitude of your own heart.
Observe my abhorrence of all pride and vanity, and unholy desires,
and how I send the sword of my Spirit like a ploughshare
through their first stirrings within you.
Observe how I love and cherish all that is meek, and tender, and patient,
and self-denying,
and how I comfort you in every affliction by drawing you towards these precious things.
In a word, "`_observe my ways._`"

=== XLIX

[quote.scripture, , Philippians 4:5]
____
Let your moderation be known unto all men.
____

It is a vast attainment that of moderation.
Persons with lively imaginations and strong feelings,
are always apt to run into extremes in thinking, speaking, and acting;
and the mischief hereby done to the meek, tender seed of the divine life in their souls,
is inconceivable.
It has been well said by a deeply taught servant of God, that "`the Holy Spirit,
when it reveals or manifests itself to the soul, comes always with great meekness,
humility, and calmness, like the still small voice to Elijah.`"
It is good to remember this, and constantly to feel after a cool, equable state of mind.
Truth may be considered as the spiritual centre of gravity in all things;
the minute point to which they tend, and from which they radiate.
The least deviation from this centre has a tendency to cloud the mind;
and when the deviation becomes great,
and the individual is wholly gone away from the attraction of his centre,
he works in the dark, and flounders about from one extreme to another;
unsettled--unbalanced--and only making "`confusion worse confounded.`"

=== L

[quote.scripture, , Psalm 18:25-26]
____
With the merciful you will show yourself merciful;
with an upright man you will show yourself upright.
With the pure you will show yourself pure,
and with the devious you will show yourself shrewd.
____

The Spirit of the Lord is either a source of comfort and joy,
or of disquiet even to torment.
It is from the reception we give to it that the whole
of our internal peace or misery is produced.
When our dispositions of heart and feeling are merciful, upright, and pure,
it readily unites itself to them, and by its cheering and illuminating influence,
it invigorates them with holy light and life.
But when it encounters devious and unholy tempers,
the opposition of its divine nature to such thorns and briers,
renders their evil more keenly perceptible,
and the disorder and distress which it occasions more insupportable.
Great need have we, therefore,
to keep a steadfast watch over the nature of the thoughts
and feelings we permit to obtain a dwelling within us;
and to make it our constant prayer to God that he would "`cleanse
the thoughts of our hearts by the inspiration of his Holy Spirit.`"
That divine petition, "`make me a clean heart, O God,
and renew a right spirit within me,`" when sincerely offered up,
never fails of receiving a favourable response.

=== LI

[quote.scripture, , Isaiah 26:7]
____
The way of the just is uprightness; O most upright, you weigh the path of the just.
____

There is a state spoken of by the Apostle as belonging to those who are
appointed to the use of "`solid food;`" "`even those,`" he says,
"`who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil.`"
Unquestionably, it is possible to arrive at this state; but it is only in one way,
and that is, by watching closely how the Spirit of the Lord acts upon our conscience,
by causing us to detect the smallest deviation from the line of rectitude.

"`O most upright, you weigh the path of the just.`"
By a delicacy of impression unobserved by the carnal mind,
but quite perceptible to the spiritual one,
the divine Spirit causes the way of the human being to be
so nicely adjusted in the scales of truth and propriety,
that the slightest oscillation is instantly revealed
in order that it may be as instantly rectified.
It is in this way alone that the "`just weight`" which is the Lord`'s,
can be established and maintained in the soul, to its eternal rest and blessedness.

[quote.scripture, , 2 Corinthians 6:2]
____
Behold, now is the accepted time; behold, now is the day of salvation.
____

We are very prone in our prayers, and in all our religious exercises,
to overlook the immediate impression and effect which they are to produce,
and to regard them as something laid up for futurity,
and the results of which are remote.
But the way to benefit by our devotional duties,
is to feel the present help they extend to us.
This should always be peace, composure of mind,
and redemption from the confusion and distress which ensues from being immersed
in the bottomless pit of self-hood and its bewildering multiplicities.

Now, at this present moment,
is "`the accepted time,`" in which the Spirit of God acts upon the soul;
for NOW is the mode in which the source of all truth operates on all things.
They never remain motionless, but from moment to moment progress to their destined point,
by the seeming paradox, but nevertheless most comprehensive and wonderful fact,
of standing firm under the direct influence of the I AM. Thus the
fruits and plants of the earth advance in the truth of _their_ condition;
and thus ought we to abide in the fulness of His ever present _now,_
and know it as the means and the time of salvation from
sin and of growing up into Him who is "`head over all,
in all things.`"

=== LIII

[quote.scripture, , Isaiah 28:16]
____
He that believes shall not make haste.
____

Amidst the fluctuations of hope and fear,
the manifold anxieties respecting uncertain evils,
and the distress attendant upon those that are real and present,
to be able to wait patiently for better days,
and to leave all things that concern us in the hands of God,
with quiet confidence that He knows better than we do their aim and end,--is
to be in the possession of a sublime principle of conduct,
and one which well deserves the name given to it by the apostle of "`precious faith.`"
This principle it is which alone regulates the energies of the will,
and so subdues its impetuous eagerness to anticipate and hasten
on the circumstances respecting which it desires to be satisfied,
that it sinks down into tranquil submission,
content to let the things of the morrow take care of themselves.
But we must remember that this glorious principle
will not slide into our minds while we are asleep.
It must be strenuously wrestled for; and, as a great help to success,
let us learn with untiring perseverance,
and with unswerving constancy "`not to make haste.`"

=== LIV

[quote.scripture, , Psalm 18:23]
____
I was also upright before him, and I kept myself from my iniquity.
____

Every human being has some bosom sin,
some besetting iniquity which lays him peculiarly
open to the temptations of his spiritual enemies;
and it should be his constant aim to wage unceasing warfare
with this treacherous foe "`of his own household.`"

It is one of the most efficacious of aids in this work of inward purification,
to consider that we are always in the presence of God; that "`He is about our path,
and about our bed,
and spies out all our ways;`" nor can any desire
be more fraught with the means of its own fulfilment,
than that which prompts the soul to long to be "`upright before Him.`"
What a holy check upon the first motions to evil is the remembrance
"`You-Are-the-God-Who-Sees!`"--and the salutary recollection that
"`all things are naked and open to the eyes of Him to whom we must give account.`"
O, cherish then, as the apple of your eye, every holy thought, every gentle,
loving temper; that in the strength and power of goodness,
you may be able to keep yourself from your iniquity, and to be upright before your God.

=== LV

[quote.scripture, , 1 Cor. 13:6]
____
Rejoices in the truth.
____

It is highly desirable, but in our corrupt condition, exceedingly difficult,
to love truth simply as truth, and on account of its beautiful pureness.
The intensity of self-love,
and the desire of self-aggrandisement pollute the
motives even of our best thoughts and deeds;
and if we venture to look at them closely,
we shall too often discover that we are rather seeking something for self to feed upon,
than good for its own sake.

It is one of the features in the divine portrait from which the text is taken,
that she "`seeks not her own;`" and if we would bring our minds
into as near a resemblance as we can to this heavenly image,
we must again and again contemplate the loveliness of love
as portrayed in the characteristics of it here specified.
Love for loving`'s sake is to be our model.
Love, rejoicing in nothing but the truth!
Love, seeking nothing for herself, no, not even her own.
Never behaving herself unseemly, never being easily provoked; but,
bearing all things like a patient lamb,
and finding her joy in the sweet simplicity of truth.

=== LVI

[quote.scripture, , Isaiah 63:9]
____
In all their affliction he was afflicted, and the angel of his presence saved them;
in his love and in his pity he redeemed them;
and he bore them and carried them all the days of old.
____

The Germans have a beautiful idea of the presence of an angel,
when the soul sinks unexpectedly into a deep and sweet silence.
"`An angel has passed by!`"--they say.
There should be a frequent seeking for the serene, quiet,
waiting state in which the Angel of God`'s presence may be felt to pass by.
Ah, how continually do we need to come under the shadow of this celestial visitant!
How frequent are the mournful occasions in which we require to be reminded that
the angel of our heavenly Father`'s presence is with us in all our afflictions,
and that he shares them with us, and carries us triumphantly over their power!
But the faith, alas, is lacking;
and thus it happens that God is not known as his
Holy Spirit yearns to make Him known to us,
as "`our refuge and strength, our very present help in time of trouble.`"
How true is the sorrowful complaint, "`how often would I have gathered you,
and you would not!`"

=== LVII

[quote.scripture, , "Psalm 139:3,2"]
____
You compass my path and my lying down,
and are acquainted with all my ways... You understand my thoughts afar off.
____

It is quite certain that the Teacher which is effectually
to influence and instruct the soul in a way of righteousness,
must be one that has access to the thoughts and desires of the heart:
since it is with these that all good and evil purposes begin,
and from there proceed into acts.
Hence, the gift of God`'s Spirit,
and the consciousness of the human being that he possesses this gift,
are the helpers to which we must turn in the work of inward redemption from sin.
If we had not the testimony of Scripture to the presence
of this Almighty Judge and Saviour within us,
still, from the analogy to be observed in the dealings of Providence,
we might be assured that we should not be left destitute of what is so constantly needed.
"`Said I not to you that if you would believe, you should see the glory of God?`"
But as the holy word has it, "`the stork in the heavens knows her appointed times,
and the turtle, and the crane, and the swallow observe the time of their coming;
but my people know not the judgment of the Lord`" Jer.
8:7.

=== LVIII

[quote.scripture, , Philippians 4:1]
____
Stand fast in the Lord.
____

A command to abide,--to stand fast,--to hold fast,--to cleave,--in a word,
steadfastly to _adhere_ to that of God which is made manifest to our consciences,
is continually enforced upon us as a religious duty in the Scriptures;
and in the old Testament we repeatedly find a state of sureness
and stability set forth as the result of trusting in God.
"`They that trust in the Lord shall be as Mount Zion which cannot be removed,
but which stands fast forever.`"

It only remains then,
that we daily feel after a secret consciousness of
something in our souls which is of God,
and that we gather to, and concentrate our minds upon,
this interior sense of the holy power of the Lord.
But we must remember that this precious thing is not found in a moment,
nor just as we choose to seek for it in a fitful and capricious way.
We must wait upon it in humble silence; reverently watching for its motions,
and dutifully obeying such of them as we can understand;
and there are few that are not plainly intelligible
to the docile and simple-minded scholar.

=== LIX

[quote.scripture, , Psalm 35:1, 3]
____
Plead my cause, O Lord, with them that strive with me;
fight against them that fight against me... Stop the way against them that persecute me;
say unto my soul, I am your salvation.
____

If we are in a state of spiritual regeneration,
we shall be distinctly conscious every day that we live, and probably,
many times in a day, of something that opposes, wrestles with, and, as it were,
"`_stops the way_`" against all evil thoughts and desires.
Let us, with the most prompt decision, yield up our will to this antagonist of sin, self,
and Satan.
Remember the holy word which says "`the battle is not yours, but God`'s.`" And again,
"`the Lord shall fight for you, and you shall hold your peace.`"
Precious are those words of needful comfort!
For what _can_ we do of ourselves, in our various exigencies of a spiritual kind?
What do we know of the strength and subtlety of our invisible foes?
Just nothing:
and our first step to help is firmly to be persuaded that we do indeed know nothing,
and therefore can do nothing, towards delivering ourselves out of their power.
Then we can commit our way unto the Lord, who _does_ know just what is good for us;
and who permits our particular trials and temptations for the proving of our faith,
and the purification of our hearts.

=== LX

[quote.scripture, , Psalm 55:19]
____
Because they have no changes, therefore they fear not God.
____

It is said in Scripture,
that "`the prosperity of fools shall destroy them;`" and unquestionably,
with respect to the deadening influence which it commonly possesses
of increasing the natural hardness and unbelief of the heart,
no state is much more to be dreaded than one of uninterrupted ease and prosperity.
"`He that has not suffered, what does he know?`"
To bring us into true wisdom therefore,
it pleases the mercy and goodness of God to chequer our earthly lot with trial and vicissitude.
He "`leads us about,`" and that as it were blindfolded;
asking us for nothing but childlike trust,
and a full conviction that "`he knows the thoughts that he thinks towards us;
and that they are thoughts of good and not of evil.`"

Thus strengthened with might by his Spirit imparting faith to our inner man,
we may come up safely "`through the wilderness,
leaning on our Beloved;`" and "`amidst all the changes and chances of
this mortal life,`" may grow the stronger through their instrumentality;
since every fluctuation in things temporal only will help us more constantly to turn,
and to cleave to those which are eternal.

=== LXI

[quote.scripture, , Psalm 20:1-4]
____
May the Lord hear you in the day of trouble; may the name of the God of Jacob defend you;
may he send you help from the sanctuary, and strengthen you out of Zion;
may he remember all your offerings, and accept your burnt sacrifice.
May he grant you according to your heart`'s desire, and fulfill all your purpose.
____

How full of sweetness are these divine words!--how
entirely adapted to the case of a suffering,
sorrowing sinner!--whose soul, though broken by chastisement, is still repentant,
still faithful in kissing the hand that holds the rod,
and able to say with the patriarch, "`though he slay me, yet will I trust him.`"

You may safely do so, "`O, you afflicted,
tossed with tempest and not comforted`"--nor yet capable of being
comforted with the consolations which this world has to offer you.

Be it enough that the Lord hears you in this your day of trouble,
and secretly and surely defends you from all harm; that he strengthens you out of Zion,
his city of peace and truth; that he remembers all your tears and prayers,
and will in his own good time, grant you their full fruition in his heavenly kingdom.

=== LXII

[quote.scripture, , Ephesians 4:22-24]

That you put off, concerning your former conduct,
the old man which grows corrupt according to the deceitful lusts,
and be renewed in the spirit of your mind,
and that you put on the new man which was created according to God,
in righteousness and true holiness.
____

O You that administer strength to the feeble,
enable me to resist and reject all the evil tempers
and habits of my corrupt and fallen nature;
and be pleased to reveal to me, in order that I may abhor and renounce them,
all the false covetings of my desperately wicked and deceitful heart.
And, seeing that it is the work of your blessed Spirit, and His alone,
to renew me in the spirit of my mind, by putting into it good desires,
and begetting me anew into your likeness,
O grant me grace to unite my will with every holy and righteous aspiration,
every breathing after a new and better life,
and every motion of the "`new man,`" which that good Spirit may cause to stir within me;
that thus I may "`grow up into Him in all things,`" who is the Son of your love,
and the everlasting Saviour and Redeemer of all who put their trust in Him.
Amen.

=== LXIII

[quote.scripture, , Proverbs 10:19]
____
In the multitude of words sin is not lacking; but he who restrains his lips is wise.
____

Aim at repressing that nature which is so prone to let itself out in words.
And do not imagine that this is to be done simply
by refraining the utterance of the bodily lips;
for there is a tongue _within_ that requires to be silenced,
and which is perpetually assailing us with the multitude
of words in which sin is seldom lacking.
This tongue proceeds from the false, earthly life of the natural man,
which is always in league with the spirit of this world;
the spirit of the false woman spoken of in Scripture,
"`the stranger which flatters with her words.`"
Watch your way,
and promptly cut off all occasion of falling through the snares of this spirit,
by endeavouring as much as possible to preserve in your inner nature, a steadfast,
_right-on_ gaze.
"`Let your eyes look right on, and let your eyelids look straight before you.
Turn not to the right hand nor the left`" Proverbs 4:25, 27.

=== LXIV

[quote.scripture, , Hosea 6:5]
____
Your judgments are as the light that goes forth.
____

The motions of the Spirit of God are various as to their modes of manifestation,
but the term which seems the most adequately to express them is
that of light--"`Whatsoever does make manifest is light.`"
Now this is a remarkable and very profound expression, testifying in concise terms,
but with most comprehensive meaning, the nature and purpose of the Holy Spirit.
It makes things "`manifest`" to the soul--that is its purpose; and it does so,
by the agency of light, which is its nature.
Thus, it shines--it shows--but it does not argue.
Argument bespeaks two views of a case;
but there are no double views--no doubts--and no room for arguments
and opinions in the revelations of the Spirit of God.
They enlighten, and point to the path the believer is to take;
but they enter into no reasonings thereon.
Reason has its own place and province in the nature of the human being;
but things that are spiritual must be judged of, and decided,
by a higher agent than reason.
It is by obedience that the soul gets to know the way of this divine agent; for,
as he walks in the path of the just,
he finds that it is one of light which shines more and more unto the perfect day.

=== LXV

[quote.scripture, , Ephesians 4:30]
____
Grieve not the Holy Spirit of God.
____

The name of this Spirit is beautifully and truly that of "`the Comforter;`"
and wise and needful is the counsel which tells us not to grieve him.
For he comes, too often, to a treacherous heart; and too sadly certain is it,
that he presents himself, for the most part, only to be despised and rejected.
O you,
who delight in mercy--you who give your good Spirit to instruct
us--you who have pleaded with us by the tender remonstrance,
"`O, that you had hearkened to my commandments,
then should your peace have flowed as a river,
and your righteousness as the waves of the sea,`"
be pleased to incline our hearts to love,
and to long for, the sweet visitations of the Holy Spirit, the Comforter.
Imbue us so deeply with the gentleness and lovingkindness of his heavenly nature,
which is your nature, O loving Father, that we may ever find it too hard,
and too hateful a sin,
to grieve him by indulging in any of the evil tempers
that are contrary to his healing and redeeming grace.

=== LXVI

[quote.scripture, , Psalm 65:5, 7]
____
By terrible things in righteousness will you answer us, O God of our salvation;
who are the confidence of all the ends of the earth...
Which stills the noise of the seas,
the noise of their waves, and the tumult of the people.
____

We cannot make much in a way of personal application of these scriptures,
while we look only at their literal meaning;
but what may we not make of them of the deepest instruction,
and as a means of helping us to the sweetest peace,
when it is given us to penetrate into their hidden and spiritual meaning!

Whatever tends to purify the heart, and deliver it from evil,
must in the necessity of its nature, be terrible to the corrupt part of us.
When therefore, the Father of mercies answers our prayers for truth and holiness,
it must needs be by such "`terrible things`" as alarm and distract poor flesh and blood,
and cause it to be "`at its wits`' end.`"
But it is through such exercises as these, _and through these alone,_
that we learn the salutary lesson of silently and patiently
composing ourselves to bear the Lord`'s will.
It is thus that we become recipients of his blessed Spirit`'s influence;
and well assured, from actual experience,
how certainly it is _that_ which stills the tumult of the stormy ocean of disordered nature.

=== LXVII

[quote.scripture, , 1 John 4:18]
____
There is no fear in love; but perfect love casts out fear; because fear has torment.
____

Fear is natural to a sinful and corrupt state of being;
for a secret instinct assures those who are in this condition that it is an insecure one.
We have a consciousness quite independent of the knowledge we gather from scripture,
that we have lapsed from our proper place of dependence upon, and obedience to,
the God who made us.
The mysterious circumstances that surround us, the vicissitudes and sufferings,
and finally, the death of human beings,
necessarily add to the fear which belongs to us as fallen creatures,
and induce irritability, bitterness, hatred,
and all the dark feelings which make their dwelling in the gloomy chamber of fear.
It is only by walking in the light of love where no darkness is,
and no bitter plant can spring up, that we rise out of the dominion of fear.
"`But we cannot command the power to love,`" it may be said.
True; we cannot; but we can keep near to that Spirit which teaches us to pity,
and forgive, and which melts and prepares our hearts to receive ability to love.

=== LXVIII

[quote.scripture, , Proverbs 11:17]
____
The merciful man does good to his own soul; but he that is cruel troubles his own flesh.
____

If it were only as means to our own individual happiness and peace,
it would behoove us to aim at establishing in our minds a principle of benevolence;
a spirit of kindness, forgiveness, forbearance, and compassion.
Precious is that holy precept,
"`let the peace of God _rule_ in your hearts...and be thankful.`"

Here is work enough cut out to our hands.
Work for every day, and every hour in the day, through the longest life;
work which asks for an unceasing warfare with every bitter thought, every evil surmise,
every stirring of revenge, of anger, of malice, of envy.
But, whatever the pain and difficulty which attends the performance of this work,
it is well worth undergoing it.
Well worth the sharpest and most protracted conflict is it,
to be delivered from the gloom, and restlessness,
and internal torment which are part and parcel of all evil tempers.

Truly indeed, as the holy text has it,
does he that is cruel "`trouble his own flesh;`"
while in every thought and deed of kindness and mercy,
he brings blessed and everlasting good into his own soul.

=== LXIX

[quote.scripture, , Job 28:7-8]
____
There is a path which no fowl knows, and which the vulture`'s eye has not seen;
the lion`'s whelps have not trodden it, nor the fierce lion passed by it.
____

This is the path of holiness, where no fierce passions, no vulturous eyes,
nor crooked serpents can find entrance.
It is to be sought where alone it can be found, in that still,
quiet silence which opens the gate that leads to it.
The Lord`'s favour is towards this gate;
for He "`loves the gates of Zion (the city of peace) more than all the
dwellings of Jacob;`" and He is easier found at this portal of interior,
humble passivity, than by any of the ways and means of man`'s contriving.
And of this be assured, that if He be not found in a way of joy and comfort,
He will surely be met with in a way which strengthens patience, purity, peace,
and ability to do or to suffer the trials of the day and hour.
"`Wait then, on the Lord; be of good courage, and He shall strengthen your heart; wait,
I say, on the Lord`" Psalm 27:14.

=== LXX

[quote.scripture, , Philippians 2:13]
____
For it is God which works in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure.
____

There is a vast variety of religious profession,
and many are the cries of "`lo here,`" and "`lo there,`" and "`I
am of Paul and I of Apollos;`" and there is a wonderful deal of
doctrinal knowledge exceedingly rife at the present day;
but the whole _gist_ of the matter,
in so far as it regards the principle of holy faith which
is to regulate our walk and conduct in this world,
may be said to lie in these words of the apostle;
"`it is God that works in you both to will and to do of His good pleasure.`"

Let this be but sincerely believed,
let there be established in the soul an abiding sense of the presence of God within it,
directing, warning, and _working_ in it both to will and to do,
and there can remain no doubt, no fear,
no uncertainty on the creature`'s part as to the nature of the Creator,
nor yet of its own direct and intimate, and most blessed connection with Him.
And this sense of our close and living relationship with God,
is what our religion is to do for us, or it will be found,
as to life and reality,--to have done nothing,
though we could talk of its doctrines with the tongue of an archangel.

=== LXXI

[quote.scripture, , Psalm 110:3]
____
Your people shall be willing in the day of your power,
in the beauties of holiness from the womb of the morning; you have the dew of your youth.
____

The day of trial of any kind is the day of God`'s power;
the time in which the smallest degree in which the
soul may be possessed of the divine life,
will be sure to manifest its presence; and then it is that the beauties of holiness,
its faith, patience and love, bloom forth more lovely than the rising of the early day,
or "`a morning without clouds.`"

Why then, should we allow any anxiety or doubt to harass our minds,
as to whether or not we shall be able to do or to suffer apprehended exigencies?
All things are possible while our eye is fixed upon God,
and we establish ourselves upon quiet confidence in His aid;
and nothing is possible in the way of endurance without this inward fixedness of soul.
Let the language of the psalmist be always present in moments of despondency;
"`why are you cast down O my soul, and why are you disquieted within me?
Hope in God, for I shall yet praise Him, who is the health of my countenance and my God.`"

=== LXXII

[quote.scripture, , Proverbs 22:5]
____
Thorns and snares are in the way of the perverse;
he who guards his soul will be far from them.
____

The keeping watch and guard over the soul,
the constantly having an eye upon what is going on there, is the one thing needful;
and a very high state of spirituality has been obtained by whoever is
well grounded in the science of "`keeping his heart with all diligence.`"
The question then arises of "`how is this to be done?`"
Not by "`heaping up to ourselves teachers;`" not by any process of reasoning;
not by seeking to fortify ourselves with good resolutions
against absent trials and temptations.
No;
it is by watching our way with steady and persevering attention to the present moment;
and, as cautious travellers who are pursuing a dangerous path,
look neither to the right hand nor to the left,
lest they should get entangled amidst thorns and briers, so we are to go right on,
keeping a single eye to the present step we have to take,
and at every difficulty to feel after the present patience it demands.
Nothing is more simple than the process of "`keeping our souls,`"
but owing to the intense corruption which embondages them,
nothing is more difficult to accomplish.
Only let us be faithful, and strength will be sure to arise as it is needed.

=== LXXIII

[quote.scripture, , 2 Cor. 10:1]
____
Now I, Paul, myself am pleading with you by the meekness and gentleness of Christ...
____

There are certain words,
and peculiar phrases in Scripture which are in themselves a prayer and a sermon.
This of "`the meekness and gentleness of Christ,`" how full of sweetness,
how suggestive of love and beauty, and of all that the human creature needs,
or can yearn for, of goodness, is it!

We only know the nature of God through the Son of his love,
even "`Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God.`"
He, "`whose goings forth have been from everlasting,`" and who,
before the days of Abraham, was still I AM,
he it is whose characteristics are "`meekness and gentleness.`"
What have we then to do,
but to pray to the Father that he would infuse into
us the Spirit of this meek and gentle one,
and cause us to find, in the exercise of his patient and lamb-like nature,
the true happiness for which it was his good pleasure to call us into existence?

=== LXXIV

[quote.scripture, , Psalm 27:4]
____
One thing I have desired of the Lord, that will I seek:
that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life,
to behold the beauty of the Lord, and to inquire in his temple.
____

To behold the beauty of the Lord, and to inquire at the Fountain of all Perfection,
for a solution of the wonders, the glories,
and the exquisite marvels of his creation;--to drink in fresh knowledge
of our Great Creator`'s blessed nature of love and loveliness--think,
O soul of man, what satiation of joy this must be, when, even now,
obscured and perplexed as it is by the intermixture of evil which meets us everywhere,
the radiance of his beauty still gleams forth to cheer and delight our souls,
even as the natural light of the sun revives and comforts our bodies.

In the melody and harmony of music, in the beautiful manifestation which imagination,
through the power of genius, makes to us,
of a perfection and a rapture for which we sigh,--and of a love for which
we pant,--"`in all things fair and sweet,`" we trace his presence,
"`but dimly seen,`" as yet, indeed, but sufficiently discerned by the trusting,
honest heart, to prompt the supplication, "`one thing I ask of You,
dear Lord,--THYSELF!`"

=== LXXV

[quote.scripture, , Proverbs 14:3]
____
In the mouth of the foolish is a rod of pride;
but the lips of the wise shall preserve them.
____

Attend carefully to the language of the thoughts,
for these "`are counsellors that feelingly persuade us what we are.`"
Most true is it that "`in the mouth of the foolish there is a rod of pride;`"
and equally true is it that in this matter of pride and self-worship,
"`we offend all.`"
The point we have to ascertain is, whether,
being conscious of this innate bent of our souls to "`secret
sins`" on the score of vanity and personal adulation,
we cause this "`rod of pride`" to be instantly renounced as a foolish thing;
or whether we unite with and cherish, and help it to substantiate itself into a habit.

Let us observe how this matter stands with us; and above all things,
let us inquire diligently if the chaste,
humble whisperings of that "`still small voice`"
which reproves and subdues all the folly of self-exaltation,
be reverently hearkened to.
Very near to us, we grant, is the nature that sins; but equally near to us,
if we are careful to look for it,
are the lips of the wise Teacher who preserves _from_ sin.

=== LXXVI

[quote.scripture, , Jeremiah 7:24]
____
But they hearkened not, nor inclined their ear;
but walked in the counsels and in the imagination of their evil heart,
and went backward and not forward.
____

That we should "`hearken`" and "`incline the ear,`" are
words of counsel frequently given to us in the scriptures.
Now, what do they mean?
We hear them as implying something very plain and intelligible; but,
plain and intelligible as it may seem, it is scarcely too much to say,
that not one in a thousand who hears these words,
has the least idea of the particular mental exercise to which they point.

It is usually supposed that the hearkening and the
inclining of the ear so often spoken of,
has reference to the listening with our outward ears to
the preaching of the appointed ministers of the gospel.
But the hearkening spoken of alludes to something
much closer to us than any external ministry.
"`Hearken to me, you that know righteousness, the people in whose heart is my law.`"
This is what we have to hear, and to which we must incline our ear, namely:
the law of the Lord--whose function it is to convert (that is,
to change) the course of the soul,
by delivering it from walking in its own counsels and evil imaginations,
and causing it to go forward unto growth in grace.

=== LXXVII

[quote.scripture, , Proverbs 14:8]
____
The wisdom of the prudent is to understand his way.
____

This understanding of our way is a matter of the utmost importance;
for it comprises much more than at the first glance we can suppose it to mean.
What is it to understand our way?
Is it not clearly to perceive what we are really
about in our habits of thought and action,
and whether it corresponds to what we ought to be about?
Is it not thoroughly to understand what we desire, and what God desires of us,
and if there be unity between His will and ours?
Is it not to understand what is true, solid, and worthy of being loved, and sought,
and firmly held;
and being able to separate it at a glance from what is false and superficial?

Surely it is.
Surely this is the "`wisdom of the prudent;`" and all we have to ask is,
"`how shall I come by it?`"
Come to that in your own heart which limits thoughts, and restrains folly;
and which cements and builds something solid in your mind;
and establish it as a certainty,
that this wisdom will never come while you are dozing in your arm chair;
but that you must, as it were, go through fire and water to find it.

____
If I have walked with vanity,
or if my foot has hastened to deceit... If my step has turned out of the way,
and my heart walked after my eyes, etc.
____

Keep to that clear, pure,
intuitive perception of the truth which will reveal to you much quicker than words can,
when you are in danger of "`walking with vanity,`"
and when your foot is about to "`hasten to deceit.`"

Know what the "`turning out of the way,`" and letting
the "`heart walk after the eye`" means;
and keep close to that inward reprover which restrains this "`walking of the soul.`"
In a word, feel continually something which governs,
and in so far as your nature requires it, which _pains_ you;
for there can be no yoke put upon the wildness and
impulsive willfulness of the corrupt part,
which does not give pain; and if you desire to obtain a habit of noble self-command,
and of courage to "`stand in the evil day,`" you must never be afraid of pain.
The only thing you have to fear,
is the voice of that false spirit spoken of in scripture,
"`which with her enticing speech,`" and her enticing soothings and delights,
beguiles the soul into walking with vanity, and "`hastening to deceit.`"

____
Why did you sit among the sheepfolds, to hear the pipings for the flocks?
____

There is a strange and most seductive pleasure in the tender kind of melancholy
which accompanies the backward glance of the mind upon days that are gone.
We do not think it possible that we should suffer loss,
but rather that we should be improved on the moral
side of our being by indulging in these reminiscences.
But this is a mistake.
The tenderness which seems to us so amiable, is not of the kind which improves the heart;
for we may observe that _self_ is always the prominent object in the panorama;
and as a proof that this is the case, and that there is no enlargement of soul,
or expansiveness of love, in such emotions,
let us remark how small and vapid the interest is,
with which we hear other people dilate upon such themes,
and the feelings which they excite in _their_ minds.
We are to keep a _forward,_ not a backward glance upon our path;
and to renounce as ignoble and enervating,
those delusive impulses which lead us to gather a halo of
interests round everything that relates to ourselves.

[quote.scripture, , 1 John 5:21]
____
Little children keep yourselves from idols.
____

How prone is the heart to dwell, and to work, in the chambers of imagery;
and how totally unconscious is it that this is a "`work of errors,`"
till the Spirit of Truth reveals its root and tendency!
The morbid feeding of the mind upon dead remembrances, or equally dead expectations,
and the revelling upon images and idols,
arise from the false activities of the corrupt nature;
which not only bring no fruit to perfection themselves,
but which hinder the springing of the good seed that might do so.
Wise then is the counsel which enjoins us to keep ourselves from them.
Keep to the present thing and moment;
no matter how trifling (so that it comes in the reasonable and proper course
of things) nor how uninteresting--nor how wearisome--nor yet how painful.
The immediate object of the immediate instant, is the only reality we possess;
and by minding only realities, we shall always be in the truth,
and always be ready for whatever may be appointed
for us in the yet unopened book of destiny.
Thus, being girded up, and with eyes looking straight before us,
we shall be built into a stable, enduring condition of moral being,
and not have a shadowy existence in the vapour and confusion of interior phantasmagoria.

____
I discipline my body and bring it into subjection.
____

What a pleasant and easy thing it is to hear or read, while sitting at our ease,
striking and instructive precepts and truths;
and what a painful exercise it is to be tried with the circumstances which
can alone render those precepts and truths of any practical value to us!

How is it with you, my soul in such a case?
Do you put aside the wise monitor in your conscience when
it suggests that the time is come for proving your principles,
and showing how much of earnestness and sincerity there was in
your desire to become well instructed unto righteousness?
Do you yield to the coaxing and caressing of another counsellor who says--"`not now`"--or
"`this is a trifle`"--there can be no harm in a little self-indulgence here?--Or,
do you brace yourself with strength, and rise to the occasion,
by bringing self into subjection, and nobly disdaining, like the Apostle,
to be brought under the power of anything, however lawful?

=== LXXXII

[quote.scripture, , Proverbs 2:4-5]
____
If you seek her as silver, and search for her as for hidden treasures;
then shall you understand the fear of the Lord, and find the knowledge of God.
____

To search for wisdom as for hidden treasures, is not to study books,
or to work vehemently in the will of the natural understanding;
but rather to stop and silence these exertions of the fleshly mind,
and to bring them into meek obedience to something better than themselves.
If anyone takes upon himself to suppose that his inward passivity requires no effort,
and is, in point of fact, an idle and profitless proceeding,
let him try for a quarter of an hour to be silent before the Lord,
and thus put himself in a condition to be _acted upon_ instead of acting.

Let him be made to see and feel what it involves of self-government, and self-resistance,
to sit mentally still, and to close the door upon every thought and imagination.
Then, and not till then,
he will be able to form some conception of what is meant by "`searching
for wisdom as for hidden treasures,`" and will,
perhaps, perceive that the mere standing still for a time in spirit,
introduces a savour of heavenly wisdom into the soul which disposes it to long for more.

Strengthened with might by his Spirit in the inner man.
____

No virtue is so constantly needed by the Christian pilgrim,
and none so distinctly and directly brings a potent and present blessing in its exercise,
as patience;
for none puts us so perfectly in possession of all the mental
as well as spiritual power which belongs to us.
It truly strengthens us with might by the Spirit of God.

See the most highly gifted individual under trial,
who happens to be undisciplined in the government of his temper;
and how poor is the condition to which his lack of patience reduces him.
Hence,
how truly wise and dignified is the counsel which
says to us "`in your patience possess your souls.`"
As though the holy monitor had said "`expect no miracle to be worked,
no extraordinary aid extended for your deliverance in the time of trial;
but possess your soul and all its energies and capabilities, sound and unbroken,
in calm and steadfast endurance;
and thus give scope to the glorious power of God to shine through your
faith and patience to your great joyfulness and sanctification.`"

[quote.scripture, , Proverbs 3:25-26]
____
Be not afraid of sudden fear, nor of the desolation of the wicked when it comes.
For the Lord shall be your confidence, and shall keep your foot from being taken.
____

It is worthy of remark for our support and consolation in times of trouble,
how manifold and how encouraging are the commands given to us in the Scriptures,
_not to be afraid._

Most clear is it, that the wise and gracious Being who holds our destiny in his keeping,
foreseeing that in such a nature, and in such a world as ours,
we should need nothing so much as assurance from Him of safety on which to repose,
and from which to derive strength and hope when the strange
and startling circumstances of our condition--disease,
disaster, and death, rise up to terrify us--has again and again,
encouraged us to cast aside all dread, and all doubt, and to "`be strong,
and of good courage,`" and trust ourselves entirely in his hands.
The servant of the Lord therefore, has no need to be afraid of sudden fear,
nor of the desolation of the wicked; he must suffer, and he must die;
but in suffering and in death, the Lord is to be his confidence and his salvation,
on the strength of his own repeated promises that He will be so.

=== LXXXV

[quote.scripture, , Psalm 71:20]
____
You, who have shown me great and severe troubles, shall revive me again,
and bring me up again from the depths of the earth.
____

Under the influence of God`'s Holy Spirit,
and his wise and merciful guidance through them,
our "`great and severe troubles,`" prove, in their results, to be our greatest blessings,
and ill would it go with us with respect to our growth in grace,
and a fitness for heaven and holy things, without them.

What has the servant of the Lord truly learned of
his heavenly Father`'s ways and divine nature,
what has he ever acquired that has grown into a principle of conduct,
and remained with him as such,--or how has he attained to any knowledge of his sins,
and the means of redemption from their plague and power,--that
has not been learned in the time of "`severe trouble?`"
"`Receive then,`" as dear William Law says,
"`with both hands,`" every species of sorrow where with
it may please God to prepare and purify you for himself.
Be quiet, reverent, and submissive in the day of trial.
Never, at such times, lose sight of hope;
for it is through these severe exercises of soul that faith grows and is strengthened;
and they are always to be contemplated, even when they come as chastisements,
as testimonies of a love whose rebukes are for healing and for happiness.

O, that my people had hearkened unto me, and Israel had walked in my ways.
I should soon have subdued their enemies,
and turned my hand against their adversaries... He should
have fed them also with the finest of the wheat;
and with honey out of the rock should I have satisfied you.
____

"`With honey out of the rock should I have satisfied you.`"
How aptly does this figurative language illustrate the sweetness
of those consolations wherewith "`the Father of mercies,
and the God of all comforts`" supports the obedient soul under
the inflictions of the "`stern rugged nurse`" adversity.
Were our eyes opened to discern things according to their real nature,
instead of being covered with that film of ignorance
wherewith the fleshly mind clouds them,
how should we reverse the picture which imagination presents of happiness!
How full of abominations, and of deadly snares,
would then seem the objects which minister to self-gratification; and how pure,
and beautiful, and suffused with moral health and happiness, the painful, the wearisome,
the self-denying and the self-opposing circumstances which
try us with their contrariety to our will and wishes!

=== LXXXVII

[quote.scripture, , Solomon`'s Song 6:9]
____
My dove, my undefiled is but one.
____

To love, to feel, and to abide in simplicity of mind,
is to experience the power of God unto salvation;
inasmuch as it is to be redeemed by His grace from
the confusion and multiplicity of corruption.
It is by the sovereignty of Truth rising into dominion,
that evil is detected in the heart, and thoroughly judged down, and cleansed away.
"`As for our transgressions you shall purge them away.`"
How can this be done?
Simply by coming constantly to "`Christ, the power of God,
and the Wisdom of God;`" or in other words,
by coming continually to the simplicity--the _oneness,_
and singleness of mental vision which fills the "`whole body with light,`"
even "`the light which gives light to every man coming into the world.`"
This is a precious state to attain, but difficult of acquisition,
though in itself so exceedingly childlike and simple.
"`Wash and be clean,`" this is all the process.
But it demands a deep, _deep_ baptism.
"`_Wash seven times._`"
Immerse yourself thoroughly in that inward Jordan which drowns
the stirrings of sense and self,--and know only "`the one,
the undefiled, the Christ of God.`"

=== LXXXVIII

____
The Lord is faithful, who will establish you and guard you from the evil one.
____

"`The Lord is faithful.`"
How consoling is this assurance--how perfectly adapted
to strengthen us for our Christian warfare,
and to produce a firm and abiding confidence in the Divine nature! "`God is love`" also;
and He would have His whole creation to enjoy and profit by the sweetness of His love.
Look round upon that creation, among the rational part of it,
and say what real happiness there could be existing
in it without the exercise of the affections.
But it is not after the manner of earthly love, which is transient and decaying,
but by means of the love which is born of Him in the new nature,
that God shows His faithfulness towards us.
His love works in a different way from the love of the creature.
_That_ would shield its object from every sort of trial, and allow old things,
however corrupt, to remain, rather than inflict the pain of taking them away.
But the love of God shakes them to their foundation,
that those good things which cannot be shaken may remain; only asking us to believe,
that, while this earthquake of the soul is going on, "`He is faithful,
and will both establish us and guard us from the evil one.`"

=== LXXXIX

[quote.scripture, , 2 Pet. 1:1]
____
To them that have obtained like precious faith with us.
____

Faith is truly called by the apostle "`precious,`" for it is the only
principle whereby we are kept constantly enduring and constantly in peace.
But, evermore remember,
that it is a favour,--a gift to be obtained,--a living grace to grow in the heart,
not a doctrine to be learned and taken as a notion into the head,
or a conception to be worked out in the strength of the will.
All religious persons conclude that they possess faith, and some justly so conclude;
but too many among them are apt to take it for granted that
saying "`I believe,`" is tantamount to the act of faith;
and thus,
when some exigency occurs which requires the entire
surrender of themselves into the hands of God,
they find that their trust and confidence in Him is merely nominal,
and such as stands in an acquaintance with the letter and not with the Spirit.
Faith, in order to be "`precious`" to us,
must grow into life and strength from such deep experience
in the ways of God in dealing with the soul,
that the individual can boldly assert "`I know the Lord.`"

[quote.scripture, , Gal. 4:19]
____
My little children, of whom I travail in birth again, until Christ be formed in you...
____

The analogy which subsists throughout the kingdom of nature, would lead us with reason,
to expect a similar resemblance in things that are supernatural;
and as throughout the former,
everything appears to be carried to maturity in a way of birth and subsequent development,
so with respect to what is supernatural, we are authorized from scripture,
and our own experience,
to conclude that it is after the manner of a holy birth in the soul,
and a growth in grace, that we are redeemed from evil,
and made "`new creatures in Christ Jesus.`"

What encouragement does the revelation of this mystery afford,
for tenderly watching over, and cherishing, that purity of heart,
and those divine tempers,
which will bring this "`new creature`" to its destined perfection!
If the pregnant mother is tender to excess,
of the young life she hopes to bring to maturity, when at its best,
that life must one day see corruption--how careful should we be
that the divine image formed by the grace of God within us,
receives no damage--no interruption to its perfect growth!

[quote.scripture, , Psalm 51:11]
____
Cast me not away from your presence; and take not your Holy Spirit from me.
____

Repentance, when it is deep and tender like that of David,
as portrayed in this blessed psalm, is a work of most touching sweetness and love.

As frail and tempted creatures, we are continually liable to fall;
and it is to bring us back to Himself, as to a beloved Father,
not in testimony of anger--not as a mark of wrath--that God allows
our own misdoings to be our sharp and most sure chastisers.
He would have us to know nothing but rest and peace,
and serene joy in our connection with Him, as creatures linked to their Creator;
and David,
as these affecting words so powerfully testify--from
the depths of conscious remorse and anguish,
cries out for that which alone could heal--alone could satisfy his wounded heart.

Whatever the condition of sin or misery--however tried and tempted--let
us plead this earnest prayer which he offered in his distress,
and we may rest assured that we shall not plead it in vain.

And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes.
____

If there be no emotion of the human heart so pure,
so perfectly satisfying in its sweetness (and surely
there is none) as that of comforting the afflicted,
relieving the distressed, and to the utmost of our feeble ability,
wiping away the tears of the mourner;
if the exercise of pity diffuses over the spirit of poor human nature,
such a sense of exquisite blessedness, as to grant it for a time,
a foretaste of the happiness of heaven;
what must be a participation in the compassion and tenderness of God!
O, infinite, fathomless Fountain of unceasing Love,
we see but in part your divine and exquisite nature of mercy and lovingkindness;
and so near, and so overwhelming are the evils through which it reaches us,
and so many and so great the obstacles that impede our perception of it,
that we are in continual danger of losing our hold of the blessed hope
of final happiness with which that nature is designed to inspire us.
Be pleased to strengthen our faith and confidence in those precious
promises which are fitted to confirm our trust in you;
and support us through all our trials with a full
assurance that you in your own good time,
"`from every face will wipe off every tear.`"

=== XCIII

[quote.scripture, , John 7:17]
____
If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God.
____

It is only by practice, or what in the present case we will call obedience,
that we become established in religious knowledge.
"`Obedience to what?`"--perhaps you inquire.
The answer is, "`to the law of the Lord, which converts the soul;`" and which,
as it is observed and obeyed, reveals, as with the light of a sunbeam,
the least deviation into sin.
It is this law of the Spirit of life, which makes us free from the law of sin and death.
It resides in the conscience,
and is to be cultivated as a plant of our heavenly Father`'s planting;
a branch which "`he has made strong for himself,`" to witness
to the path of duty for the creature`'s benefit,
and the Creator`'s glory.

As we regard, in a practical point of view, this holy law,
by doing the divine will which it reveals to us,
we become established in the knowledge of religious doctrine, not as man,
but as God teaches it, and are never in doubt about its meaning.

____
He restores my soul; he leads me in the paths of righteousness for his name`'s sake.
____

You sometimes, perhaps, look round bewildered and saddened,
as you contemplate the sins and sorrows of a "`whole creation that
groans and travails in pain;`" and you are tempted to say,
"`it had been good for me if I had never been born; since,
being myself a sinner and a sufferer,
and my lot is cast with only other sinners and sufferers,
I can look for no renovation of my soul from them.`"

But you must turn away from depressing thoughts like these as quickly as possible.
"`Come away from the lions`' dens, and the mountains of the leopards.`"
Leave the wild, remorseless progeny of the evil passions of your nature,
and lie down in your disease of sin and weakness before the good
physician whose work it is to "`restore your soul,`" and to bring
it back from the wilderness of the sensual life,
that far country in which it has wandered like the prodigal,
and wasted its substance in riotous living;
and to lead it in the paths of righteousness and peace, for his name`'s sake.

____
No chastening for the present seems to be joyous but grievous; nevertheless,
afterward it yields the peaceable fruit of righteousness
unto them which are exercised thereby.
____

In endeavouring to bear the present disquietude, make it your constant and steady aim,
to fix your thoughts simply on the immediate moment,
as that which requires all your vigilance and all your strength;
and when you have weathered that moment with fixed attention to its duty,
you will find augmented power to meet the next.
Nothing is so fatal to the moral courage which is needful in our various trials,
as a habit of casting about to know how we shall bear some evil that is not yet come.
Depend upon it that you will bear it none the better, but probably, greatly the worse,
from anticipating the effect it is to produce.
Only possess your soul in patience by taking each moment as it comes; believing,
as you certainly may,
that God apportions to those small intervals just the strength they require.

=== XCVI

[quote.scripture, , Heb. 13:5]
____
Let your conduct be without covetousness; and be content with such things as you have.
____

It is a great victory obtained over the workings of the natural heart,
when we can be content with such things as we have.
"`But I cannot restrain as much as I wish,`" perhaps you say,
"`the longings of my will for something that I do not possess.`"
Well, if you cannot check these risings of the greed of self, you can, at least,
cut off the supplies which nourish them.
You can bind these strong desires, these "`kings of the earth with chains,
and these nobles with fetters of iron;`" and this
is often all that poor human nature can do.
But it is something, and something, moreover, that comes from God,
to have the wish to do this.
Always, therefore, venerate, as the motion of the Holy Spirit,
whatever within you points and prompts to foregoing your own will,
and which checks the wild roving fancy for this, and that, which is not needed,
and which you can very well do without.
Be assured that all that is suggested to you by the Spirit of Truth, is meek, and lowly,
and useful, and necessary, and such as leaves you satisfied with small gratifications;
and all that arises from your own spirit is restless, covetous, dissatisfied,
and unto indulgence, only asking for more.

____
His own iniquities entrap the wicked man, and he is caught in the cords of his sins.
____

It is the root, sap, and life of all happiness,
and of all capability of loving and possessing Truth, to be able to govern self.
You may certainly, give the reins to your will;
you may deny it nothing that it is in your power to grant to its importunate cravings;
but, in doing so,
you may reckon with as much certainty as you can cast up a sum in addition,
of what will be the result; and that your own iniquities will take you,
and "`you will be caught in the cords of your sins.`"
In nourishing our self-will,
we do but fatten a ferocious animal which will eventually
"`tear us in pieces when there is none to deliver.`"
"`Behold all you that kindle a fire, that compass yourselves about with sparks;
walk in the light of your fire, and of the sparks that you have kindled;
this shall you have of my hand--you shall lie down in sorrow.`"

In weariness and painfulness...
____

The Christian, "`as a good soldier,`" is often called to expect, and to be prepared for,
the endurance of painful exercises; and it behooves him to stand upon the watch,
and to do valiant battle with those feelings which would prompt him to
be in a hurry to get from under the pressure of pain and sorrow.
Whatever can minister to the relief either of bodily or mental pain,
that is lawfully within reach of a sufferer, is not to be denied;
but with respect to spiritual trials,
there is great good often enfolded in lying passive and patient,
and just simply bearing them, with no solicitude, or as little as possible,
for their speedy removal.
Use quietly the appointed means that reason and counsel may suggest for the amelioration
of your "`weariness and painfulness,`" and then be silent and still;
believing that in holy silence and submission, there is a balm for all suffering,
and a benefit far beyond what mere ease and exemption from pain can bestow.
It is a low condition of moral being that is always catering for relief from suffering,
and which recoils from adversity;
though no state is so fraught with the seeds of every virtue, and of every blessing,
as a state of trial.

____
Return you backsliding children, and I will heal your backslidings.
____

No word so graphically, and with so comprehensive a meaning,
describes the condition of the soul in relation to God,
and its contemplation of Divine things as this of backsliding.
We desire, it may be, very sincerely, to adhere to truth;--to stand in it,
and live and walk in it; so that in a measure we may be able to say with the Psalmist,
"`I have stuck unto Your testimonies.`"
We readily would feel our minds "`fastened as a nail
in a sure place,`" to a steadfast watch,
and inward waiting for the motions of the Holy Spirit; but, insensibly,
we slide back into the old nature of flesh, and then the progeny of the carnal mind,
its vain thoughts and imaginations, like a flight of locusts,
darken our spiritual atmosphere, and eat up every green thing in our land.
Still, we must not despair, but begin again, and yet again,
as often as this inroad of our soul`'s enemies occurs.
A return unto Him who knows how to pity and to heal, is always within our power;
and to this we must ever have recourse in all our transgressions.

That they should seek the Lord, in the hope that they might grope for him and find him,
though he is not far from each one of us; for in him we live and move and have our being.
____

It is one thing to have a religion, and another, to have God.
With respect to the first, as a system of doctrines, it is learned,
as everything else is learned, through the medium of education.
We are taught it by our instructors, and it enters into our heads and remains there,
just as other branches of knowledge do.
But, with respect to possessing God as a friend and father,
and feeling our relationship to Him as that ever present though
invisible being to whom we are linked as creatures with their Creator,
and to whom we may at all times resort for comfort, for counsel,
and for all the aid that our helpless souls stand in need
of,--we must look elsewhere than into books,--yes,
elsewhere than even into the Bible itself; though we must unquestionably,
turn to it in order to know how, and where, we are to seek for God;
and there we are told that we are to "`grope for the Lord,`" in
the depth of our own souls--"`in the hope that we may find him,
seeing that he is not far from each one of us.`"

Blessed be God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies,
and the God of all comfort; who comforts us in all our tribulation,
that we may be able to comfort them which are in any trouble,
by the comfort wherewith we ourselves are comforted of God.
____

How tender, how consolatory are these words!
What an atmosphere of heavenly love they breathe around the perturbed spirit!
God comforts his ministers,
that they may be able to comfort others with the same sweetness
of pity wherewith He has comforted themselves.
"`The God of all comfort`" draws near to his afflicted children,
through every medium in which they can be approached;
and he comes successfully to thousands, and tens of thousands.
Yes, even in this sinful,--in this God-defying world,
it is sweet to remember in reading such divine words of Scripture as those before us,
that they have afforded strength and consolation,
and been the source of holy joy to innumerable sufferers; as they will continue to be,
till suffering shall be no more.

You are wearied in the greatness of your way; yet you did not say, There is no hope:

____

"`Wearied in the greatness of their way,`" sated
but not satisfied--yearning for rest and peace,
but neither seeking, nor caring to seek it in straitening their path,
and contracting their desires--or in attending to what God and
their own conscience testify to be the road that leads to it--the
greater part of human beings from the cradle to the grave,
are the victims of unceasing restlessness and discontent.
Yet they struggle through it by dint of setting up first one,
and then another semblance of happiness to cheat themselves with.
The world, too, has much in it to lull the senses into a notion of joy;
and thus people find "`the life of their hand`"--the
life that satisfies the mere fleshly mind and will,
and they know no grief for the death that is passing upon their inner man.

O,
forever stand aloof from immersing yourself in the pleasures
of the dying and transitory life of this world,
whose best delights perish in the using, and what is worse,
would cause you to perish with them!

I know both how to be abased, and how to abound:
everywhere and in all things I am instructed both to be full and to be hungry,
both to abound and to suffer need.
I can do all things through Christ which strengthens me.
____

It seems an easy matter to bear prosperity; and, no doubt,
in the external and obvious sense of what prosperity produces of pleasure and self-indulgence,
it is as easy as to eat agreeable food.
But to eat agreeable food sparingly, is a difficult matter;
and in like manner to abound in any sort of prosperity,
so as not to be hurt by possessing it, is really a case of extreme hazard.
"`Pride and abundance of idleness,`" are almost inseparable from the abounding state.
It is very wholesome therefore, for the soul to live low,
and to be contented with small things.
"`To the hungry soul every bitter thing is sweet.`"
Only get the right desire after truth and righteousness,

"`Everywhere and in all things,`" the mind that seeks God,

Bind the chariot to the swift beast:
she is the beginning of the sin to the daughter of Zion.
____

It has been remarked by someone, but I forget by whom,
that if we had any due conception of the mysterious
and manifold mechanism of our own bodies,
we should be in perpetual fear of moving from our seat,
lest we should do some harm to the variety of wonders whereof we are made.
But the case is stronger with regard to the mind.
Could we understand the hazard of wrong and rapid motions there, we should,
with proper and anxious carefulness,
be ever on the watch against all hurry and eagerness.
We should always be looking to the restraining power
which checks the beginning of rash and sudden movements,
those usual and sure harbingers of mistake and sin.

It is a vast matter to keep a fixed eye upon the
swift rushing forward of the animal will,
so truly characterized in the mystical language of the prophet, as "`the swift beast.`"

A habit of bridling the thoughts is the only check
to that "`insurrection of evil doers,`" which,
when permitted to have any sway, is sure to raise in the soul.

The day of the Lord is upon all pleasant pictures.
____

We live by nature as the animals do, feeding, or hunting about for food;
only that they by their entire sensuality seek but for the body; while we,
being higher in the scale of intelligence, having satisfied the needs of the body,
proceed to cater for the gratification of the fleshly mind.
Still, it is hunting that we are engaged in,
while we are scheming for something pleasant to self;
and when is it that we are not thus scheming, till the day of the Lord comes;
the day of trouble and of disappointment;
the day which casts gloom and darkness over every "`pleasant picture`" of fancy and hope?
This is a sure day,--however long delayed in its appearance;
and greatly does it behoove us to have something ready in preparation for its arrival;
something on which to fall back; something that this terrible day will prove,
but not destroy!--To be thus provided, is not the work of a moment;
still less of a moment when all our earthly treasures and pleasures are falling to pieces.
It is the work of the entire habits of the life.
How essential then that they should be right habits!

Catch us the foxes, the little foxes that spoil the vines,
for our vines have tender grapes.
____

Cheerfulness is a sweet, pleasant, healthy state of spirit,
and should be as earnestly sought for the mind, as good air and food for the body.

But, forever distinguish between this wholesome plant, and that of levity,
which often looks so much like it, that it is very easily mistaken for it.
The fruit of this same levity is also pleasant to the taste,
but sure to produce disorder to the moral system.
It degrades the mind by ungirding it, and presenting it in dishabille;
and sometimes its undress is rather a soiled and unpleasant one.
If you would feel respectable to yourself,
never condescend to "`foolish talking and jesting, which are not fitting.`"
Feel constantly that which draws you away from such things,
and which preserves the mind equally poised as in a pair of scales;
so that the least deviation into error is instantly detected.

Whereby, when you read, you may understand my knowledge in the mystery of Christ.

"`The mystery of Christ!`"
What a hidden but glorious mystery is this!
Who can reveal it to us but You by your Spirit, Almighty Father of Spirits,
dwelling in light which no man can approach unto,
and only to be known through that manifestation of yourself
which You have been pleased to make in the Son of your love,
"`the firstborn of every creature.`"

O, reveal to me what it concerns me to know of this secret of yours,
which is with those who fear you!

Let me not take up with notions crudely conceived
by man`'s interpretations of this mystery;
but cause me so to feel the living power of it,
that I may know that it is "`Christ in me the hope of glory`" who,
by his Spirit renews me in his image, and who,
as I am obedient to the motions of that blessed Spirit,
will cause me in deed and in truth, and not in empty notions,
to be accepted in your Beloved.
Amen!

Once having tasted of "`the power of the world to come,`" or in other words having felt
the interior strength wherewith the Spirit of the Lord clothes the soul that sincerely
and constantly comes to Him for help,--be strong in faith respecting it,
and attend to nothing that evil spirits,
or evil human beings may bring before your mind to trouble and perplex you.
Your business in all your religious exercises is with God, not with creatures.
Be steadfast therefore in the faith which causes you to cleave to the Lord,
and only to Him;
"`casting all your care upon Him,`" in the full assurance that He cares for you;
not for you in the low, loose, ignorant language of sectarianism,
as one picked out to be an object of His favour from some
million or more who are rejected nobody knows why,
nor wherefore; since you have no more claim to His notice and regard than they have;
but because he has, by the regenerating power of His grace,
begotten in you the "`new creature,`" whom, as His own image,
He loves and protects from harm.

____
Why do you spend money for what is not bread, And your wages for what does not satisfy?
____

How often have I said of this and the other thing, "`how pleasant it is!`"
And so it was, and so it might be again; but still, be it as pleasant as it may,
and even as innocent and allowable as it is pleasant, being earthly and perishing,
it satisfies not.

What then will satisfy the undying hunger of the immortal soul,
and why is it endued with the appetite for joy?
Here is the answer: "`The Lord is its portion.`"
God has created it for perfect satiation in the perfections of His divine nature.
Therefore His language to this hungry soul is, "`incline your ear and come unto me.`"
Come unto Him who dwells in the deepest and most silent recesses of your solitary spirit.
This is a very simple, though, no doubt, a very difficult work.
Yes, we must not disguise the labour, nor the perseverance it demands, to bring the wild,
electric strength and activity of the natural mind into quietness and patient receptivity.
Nevertheless--be not discouraged; for "`surely there is an end,
and your expectation shall not be cut off.`"

Therefore shall the Lord of hosts send among his fat ones leanness;
and under his glory he shall kindle a burning like the burning of a fire.
____

What should we be, if left without disappointment and rebuke?
What absolute selfishness, what loathsome self-love, and pride, and arrogance,
would inflate our souls!
Even though perpetually chastised for our presumptuous purposes of personal aggrandizement,
how many rank,
luxuriant shoots of pride and self-complacency continually spring up in our hearts,
and call for the fire of the Lord to be kindled under their vain-glory.
It is the work of everlasting love and mercy when
the Lord of Hosts "`sends among these fat ones,
leanness;`" and by consuming our self-confidence in the furnace of trial and distress,
does that needful thing for us, and on us,
which we should never willingly do for ourselves.
Who are the most self-loving, the most proud, and the most unlovely of the human race,
but just those that have had the longest course of unbroken prosperity,
and who have never seen, nor wished to see, the necessity and blessedness of sorrow;
but who have loved and cherished nothing but "`the fat ones,`"--in
indulging the fleshly mind and its desires?

O my dove, in the clefts of the rock, in the secret places of the cliff,
let me see your face, let me hear your voice; for your voice is sweet,
and your face is lovely.
____

That which cleanses and beautifies the soul with goodness, must itself be beautiful;
and will be known, and sought, and loved, as an object of desire.
Hence,
the Spirit of God is love itself,--emanating from Him whose name and nature is Love;
and it is only by the strength of this Spirit`'s love,
that the soul can be united to God.
How essential therefore,
is it that in all our devotional exercises we should feel after the sweetness, meekness,
and loveliness, of the blessed Spirit which flows from Him!
This is the pure dove which hides in the clefts of our stony hearts, and rocky natures;
never lost, though concealed in the secret places of our souls;--ready always,
to make itself known to those who sigh for a sight of its beauty,
and for the healing balm of Gilead which it drops like the dew from heaven,
upon penitent hearts.^

Buried with him by baptism into death.
____

What is this death here spoken of?
To say it is the same thing as that alluded to in the words "`for you are dead,
and your life is hidden with Christ in God,`" is
only to shift the mystery and not to explain it.
Who, indeed,
shall venture upon explaining what can only be comprehended as it is practically known!
But can it be practically known?
Assuredly it can;
and if you desire to be made a partaker of the life of Christ--you
must seek it in the way of this baptism unto death.
That is to say,
you must be spiritually baptized into that inward death of all the thoughts, desires,
and stirrings, of the old nature, which makes way for the birth of the new creature,
"`created in Christ Jesus unto good works.`"
It is only as we are buried in that holy death which immerses the soul in silence,
that the rebellious thoughts and desires,
and all the sinful motions of the fleshly will can be slain; and until they _are_ slain,
there can be no dominion given to the right king and ruler of the soul.
The conflict is sharp, and we may be often defeated;
but as we are faithful and persevering, we shall certainly in the end know,
that "`greater is he that is in us, than he that is in the world.`"

I will love you, O Lord my strength.
____

When the human being can sincerely say this, he is not far from the kingdom of God.
He is in that disposition of heart to which it is the aim of his heavenly Father,
in all the dealings of his providence, to bring him;
even to expend his capacities and his affections
in devoted love for the Source of all that is lovely.
And ought this to be a hard task, O Fountain of delight and beauty?
If here, in this sinful and disordered world, and amid scenes wherein "`the carnal mind,
which is enmity against you,`" riots in strife and violence, the silent,
steady sweetness of your blessed nature still gleams forth in many a touch of tenderness;
if,
in the mother`'s love--the infant`'s smile--in the joy of mere existence which attends
the young of every kind--we perceive that all true beauty flows from you;
is it not as much an instinct of nature, as a principle of duty,
which prompts this rapturous burst of the soul--"`I will love you, O Lord, my strength!`"

____
It is not good to eat much honey; so to seek one`'s own glory is not glory.
____

The subtlety of self-love works very deeply and very dangerously,
where it is least feared, and consequently where it is least watched and resisted.
It is not so much by the flattery of others, that we are deluded into folly,
as by that insidious habit of seeking our own glory which
leads to a sort of dramatising in the secret of our hearts,
in which imagination,
the "`mistress of witchcrafts,`" is busy in exalting
_self_ into situations of great interest and attraction.
All persons who deal closely and sincerely with themselves,
will readily detect a sort of representative phantasmagoria,
as often passing within them; and, but that the claims of business,
and the pressing cares of life,
leave to most persons but little time for weaving such webs of fancy,
we should probably find the results of this castle
building in many more misdoings than it now produces.
It is a great and necessary part of a Christian`'s warfare,
to fight against all profitless thoughts;
and among these we may certainly number such as lead us to magnify our personal merits,
and to "`seek our own glory.`"

=== CXV

[quote.scripture, , Proverbs 14:29]
____
He that is hasty of spirit, exalts folly.
____

In the equitable dealings of divine Wisdom,
great mental gifts are generally balanced with some defects which
cause the condition of persons thus intellectually endowed,
to be a less enviable one, than at the first glance, it appears to be.
It is rarely, for instance, that we meet with energetic, able, and highly gifted persons,
who are not hasty, and irritable, and impatient in their feelings;
the same fire of nature that renders the individual active in practical usefulness,
kindling a quickness to feel, and a haste to act under the impulse of feeling,
which does indeed, most commonly exalt and place in a prominent point of view,
a rashness that deserves the name of folly.
In order to be able to restrain all haste to speak and act, in moments of excitement,
it is necessary that the mind should have been early trained in habits of self-restraint;
nevertheless,
though it may be late in the day to enter upon the
task of self-discipline,--no effort towards it,
even at the eleventh hour, can be lost.

____
But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness,
faith, meekness, temperance; against such there is no law.
____

The mere repetition of these divine words in an earnest and prayerful frame of mind,
will stir up some sense of their nature in the soul;
and it is only in the experience of a sense of the things spoken of,
that we ascertain the presence of their life.
Mere notions about the fruits of the Spirit, are utterly profitless.
The perception of the nature of these precious fruits may possibly be feeble,--still,
be not discouraged; only make it your aim to keep it alive by nourishing the thoughts,
desires, and actions, that minister to its growth.
We are apt to look too wide,--too far away from the centre of our own being.
Even in our religious views,
there is a sad lack of that inward focus which fixes us in the closet of the heart,
there to shut the door, and commune with our Father "`which sees in secret.`"
It is here that the fruits of the Spirit must be looked for;
since it is here they bud and blossom.
Here then, make it your business to nourish them, constantly and carefully,
by repressing all evil, and sedulously cultivating all good thoughts and feelings.

____
For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works... He is our peace.
____

It is only the "`new creature,`" begotten of the Spirit of Christ,
which can possibly hold communion with God.
Therefore, the whole work of Christianity is regeneration.
"`Except you be born again, you cannot see the Kingdom of God.`"
And as there are physical pangs and sore travail in the natural birth,
so is it impossible that the spiritual child can be born without suffering.
The passing away of "`the old leaven of malice and
wickedness,`" embraces in it very severe exercises;
but no day, perhaps no hour, should go over our heads,
without our sensibly experiencing something of the travail of our souls,
in the relinquishing of the old, and the putting on of the new man,
"`created in Christ Jesus unto good works.`"
We must have the habits, tempers, and self-indulgences which belong to the old Adam,
stripped off, as it were, inch by inch,
and submit to the process whereby "`the Lord shall wash away the
filth of the daughters of Zion;`" even "`_by the Spirit of Judgment,
and by the Spirit of burning_`" Isaiah 4:4.

____
Your heaven that is over your head shall be brass,
and the earth that is under you shall be iron;
the Lord shall make the rain of your land powder and dust.
____

How wonderfully does this figurative language describe the hard, dry,
and profitless condition of the carnal mind!
Who has not felt its wretchedness in themselves,
when sin has darkened and deadened their souls?
How watchful should we be to keep alive the Lord`'s "`pleasant plant`" within us,
by pruning and watering it continually,
and bringing it under the gracious influences of the Holy Spirit,
by spreading out our souls before his fructifying power!
How carefully should we "`gather up the stones,`" the hardening, bitter,
and evil tempers of any kind which turn the "`rain of our land into powder and dust!`"

It is deeply important to remember that the condition of our feelings is just
the atmosphere which helps or hinders the growth of our spiritual life;
and that as evil tempers blight and destroy it, so, on the contrary, all soft and loving,
and meek, and humble thoughts and aspirations,
have in them something of the dew of heaven which helps to bring it to perfection.

=== CXIX

[quote.scripture, , Psalm 46:4]
____
There is a river, the streams whereof shall make glad the city of God.
____

The city of God is the soul of the believer;
and "`the river that makes it glad,`"--is the flowing stream of his love;
and the way to enjoy this refreshing water of life is to exercise the mind in goodness,
and upon that which softens and tenders it;
always making a clear distinction between that which makes it meek by God`'s grace,
and that which enervates and weakens it by the indulgence of profitless emotions.

All maudlin sentiment, all pitying and coaxing, and petting of ourselves,
and weeping over our personal sorrows and disappointments,
have an enervating and very bad effect upon the mind.
Let us get as far away from everything of self as possible, in our spiritual exercises;
and look at, and feel after,
the beauty of those things which are "`lovely and of good report;`" purity, humility,
self-denial, patience, and above all,
"`the meekness and gentleness of Christ,`" the Lamb
that takes away the sins of the world;
whose blessed Spirit opens fountains in the desert,
and constrains the soul to say "`there is a river that makes me glad.`"

____

No promise is more often repeated in the Scriptures,
than that which assures us that we shall "`know the Lord`"; and certainly,
we can have no strength or support from our religion,
but as we _do_ know the object in whom we profess to place our confidence.

Retire inwardly, and wait to feel something of the Lord;
something of his Holy Spirit and power,
discovering and drawing away from that which is contrary to him,
and leading the soul into his holy nature and heavenly image.

which the creature abiding in, is safe; but there must be no exceeding,
or running before its leadings.

[quote.scripture, , Proverbs 21:8]
____
As for the pure, his work is right.
____

It is a blessed thing to possess a cool, well balanced, pure, healthy mind.
But, it may well be asked, who _does_ enjoy this noble possession?
None, we may boldly affirm, by nature;
for nature sends us perpetually streaming out on the surface of things,
and wandering for the gratification of our senses by the way-side,
where we are sure of being taken captive by every passing thought and thing,
and are thus, according to the language of the prophet,
"`robbed and spoiled,`" and "`snared in holes, and hidden in prison houses.`"

It is by turning in from the circumference to the centre,
that we can alone hear the voice of Him who comes
to seek and to save that which was lost.
It is in obeying the pointings and promptings of this true Teacher,
that we gradually come to understand our errors,
and to know ourselves cleansed from secret faults; and by little and little,
brought somewhat into the condition of "`the pure, whose work is right.`"

=== CXXII

[quote.scripture, , 2 Cor. 6:4]
____
Approving ourselves as the Ministers of God, in much patience, in afflictions,
in necessities, in distresses.
____

"`I am well used to tears,`" I once heard a sorrowful fellow creature say;
and there are probably, but few strong feeling persons who could not echo the remark.
But it is one thing to be "`used to tears,`" and another to be used to suffer.
Tears are too often nothing more than an indulgence to self-will,
which lays hold of such relief as the impulse of the moment prompts,
and which lavishes upon this gratification,
the opportunity which should be differently used.

If you would be strong in mental health,
_avoid tears_ as much as possible when in distress; for they exhaust,
instead of relieving with any enduring and steady benefit.

The lesson at such times, is to feel after inward quietness, silence, and patience.
No doubt, it is a hard lesson to learn, but not impossible.
The very pangs that threaten to rend the heart asunder,
when humbly and prayerfully borne,
are powerful helps to our "`approving ourselves as the ministers of God,
in much patience, in affliction, in necessities, in distresses.`"

=== CXXIII

[quote.scripture, , 1 Tim. 4:1]
____
Giving heed to seducing spirits...
____

Whenever there is an unusual uplifting of heart,
and a sensible experience of the presence of God in the soul,
the danger is great of assaults from the powers of darkness.
Every spiritual person must have observed this; and has, most likely,
occasionally fallen into the snare by "`giving heed to the seducing spirits,`" which,
at such times,
adapt themselves to the elevated condition of the soul they seek to entrap,
by coming in the form of angels of light.
We see this exemplified under all natural, as well as spiritual excitement.
How many things are said and done when pleasurable impulses prevail,
which lead to great regret!

Our only defence at such times (and indeed, at all times) is in lying low before the Lord.
It is chiefly in times of excitement, whether of grief or joy,
that the soul`'s enemies find their advantage in attacking us;
but in being calm and simple-minded, and preserving, as much as possible,
our equilibrium, we remain defended from their malice and folly; for, in truth,
nothing is so foolish as the devil; as we soon should find, if we stood still in spirit,
and merely watched against, instead of joining with, his subtle temptations.

____
And the cherubim shall stretch forth their wings on high,
covering the mercy seat with their wings... and there will I meet with you,
and I will commune with you from the mercy seat.
____

We should always think of God as diffusing peace, pardon, and love,
over the soul that earnestly turns to Him as its keeper and Creator.
The very idea of a mercy seat with its covering, outstretched wings,
is fraught with tenderness and pity;
and manifestly symbolizes the refuge which Almighty
goodness has provided for those whose weakness,
sinfulness, and snares, would so often cause them to need a place of safety.
How well was this shelter of the soul understood by the spiritually minded in
ancient times!

____
As the hart pants after the water brooks, so pants my soul after you,
O God... When shall I come and appear before God?
____

This is the language, which, as naturally as the breath goes forth,
ought to be the expression of the creature towards the Creator;
and just as much as there is of a renewed nature in the human being,
is it the vivid and true representation of his condition.
All that he beholds in the world and in himself,
all his infirmities of body and mind,--but, most of all, his frailties and sins,
he contemplates as cruel obstacles to his long desired repose, his earnestly sought,
blissful satiation in the goodness, and joy,
and beauty of the Lord his God;--of that divine being whom
he has the privilege of calling his Heavenly Father.
O, the rapture of those moments, who shall tell,
the delight of those brief glimpses of celestial joy,
when a sense of that dear Father`'s love so pervades the longing soul, that,
with the Psalmist, it can truly say, "`as the hart pants after the water brooks,
so pants my soul after you, O God!`"

____
Whatever things are true, whatever things are noble, whatever things are just,
whatever things are pure, whatever things are lovely, whatever things are of good report,
if there is any virtue and if there is anything praiseworthy--meditate on these things.
____

"`Meditate on these things!`"
Few things are of more importance than the character
and tendency of the habitual current of our thoughts;
but scarcely anything is perhaps so much disregarded;
and especially now that the strong excitements of the times keep people too busy outwardly,
to allow of their living sufficiently near to their
own interior to know what is passing there.
And thus it happens, that, while "`many run to and fro,
and knowledge is increased,`" there never, perhaps,
was a period in which spiritual truth was so little sought for, and so ill understood,
as at the present day.
But now, and ever,
the work of all true religion is _inward_ work--heart work--thought work;
and consists in cleansing the soul from every profitless and unholy desire,
and nourishing such blessed thoughts as the apostle here recommends to us.

Rest in the Lord, and wait patiently for him.
____

It is not in the fulfilment of your dreams of happiness,--not in
the realization of your cherished fancies of what is desirable,
that the satisfaction for which you are craving, can be found, O restless soul,
forever coveting--forever seeking, and forever disappointed!
It is not in impetuously rushing forward,
and directing to some external and distant object, your eager efforts to clutch it.
You do but grasp the shadow of a shade, "`and sow the wind, to reap the whirlwind.`"
Instead of going out,--__retire within.__
Sink down very low in spirit,
and dwell in the land that is very far off from the kingdom of the senses.
_Dwell_ there; that is, be still and quiet in the depths of your own spirit;
and as you are thus brought into silence, and humility,
and holy death to all the importunate activities
and vain multiplicities of your corrupt nature,
you will be made capable of understanding what it is to "`rest in the Lord,
and wait patiently for Him.`"

____
I have chosen the way of truth.
____

This is a blessed choice,
though it often leads the soul through a very straight gate and narrow way,
and what the fleshly nature shrinks from, as a painful path.
Sharp and agonizing indeed,
have often been the groans which the faithful abiding by this choice has extorted from
the pilgrims who walked in the way by which it conducted them to the Source of all Truth.

Witness, for instance, the case of Luther.
In the very crisis of the Reformation,
when he was required to face a host of powerful foes with his life in his hand,
he was assaulted fiercely by the enemy of souls,
and for a time became a prey to terrible dread of what he might have to undergo.
Still,
the consciousness of having "`chosen the way of truth,`" secretly strengthened his faith.
It was a bitter moment.

He cast himself on the ground, and gave utterance to those cries interrupted by sobs,
which none can understand but such as can feel the depth of his anguish.

"`Oh God!

I will not go away from You--I am ready to forsake
life for Your truth--patient as a lamb!`"^

It is good that a man should both hope, and quietly wait for the salvation of the Lord.

Scarcely any hour is so full fraught with affliction to the faithful child of God,
as that which follows a conviction of having yielded to some bosom sin.
There is always however, even in that bitter moment, an advocate near,
to point to the duty and expediency of "`quietly waiting for the salvation of the Lord.`"
Silence, stillness, and humility,
these are the soul`'s remedies in all its feebleness and sickness.
Were it in vigorous health,
it might be safe for it to exercise itself with more active and enlivening faculties;
but, while doomed to almost perpetual warfare with foes both outward and inward,
and that worst of enemies, "`a desperately wicked,
and deceitful heart,`" how needful is it that some help,--some
"`_present_ help in time of trouble,`" should be felt near,
on which it may rest as a stay and support,
and from which it may derive the hope of again tasting that the Lord is gracious.

In the buoyancy and boldness of youth,
there may be times when the self-sufficiency and arrogance of nature are ready
to prompt the foolish notion that it is a token of a fine spirit--becoming pride,
proper self-esteem, and the like--to give as much trouble, and consequently,
to stir up as much evil, and live as turbulently as possible, with all men.
This, is to be possessed with a demon,
which the first real touch of God`'s grace speedily exercises from the mind.
The very first impression made upon the soul by the holy Lamb of God, is peace.
"`Peace I leave with you--__my__ peace I give unto you.`"
This is its language.
There may be, and indeed, in naturally fierce and bitter tempers, there must be, much,
that for a long time, troubles the conscience,
and which renders the blessed counsel contained in the text very difficult to be obeyed;
but most assuredly, just as much as there is of God`'s truth in the heart, will there be,
even with persons afflicted with evil tempers, an earnest desire, and also a struggle,
to "`live peaceably with all men.`"

____
And this is life eternal, that they might know you, the only true God,
and Jesus Christ whom you have sent.
____

To know "`the only true God,`" and to be "`in Him that is true,`"
is to feel a sureness and fixedness of mind which bestows substance
and reality on our existence,--and an internal establishment,
which in our natural condition,
we never experience;--for while in that state we consolidate no real existence,
but are always tossing about from one phantom of imagination to another,
and "`nothing is, that is not.`"
When we begin to seek that which is true, we draw towards our right centre,
and something stable and real takes hold of us.
It has been observed by a deeply spiritual writer,^
footnote:[Madame Guyon.]
that "`God has an attractive centre,
which draws the soul more and more powerfully as she approaches Him;`" but this
centre can only be found as we "`cease from our own works,`" and yield ourselves
up in passive obedience to the sweet influence of the Holy Spirit`'s guidance.

=== CXXXII

[quote.scripture, , Proverbs 11:1]
____
Dishonest scales are an abomination to the Lord, but a just weight is his delight.
____

It is quite certain from the nature of God`'s dealings,
in so far as it is permitted us to scan them, that he gives to every created thing,
whatever is needful to its allotted condition.
Now, our human condition is one which manifestly demands a capability of judging rightly,
and acting wisely, in the various perplexing trials which accompany it.
It cannot be denied that this capacity is bestowed upon us; not indeed,
in any advantage we may possess on the score of intellect;
but in a measure of "`the true light which gives light to every
man coming into the world,`" and which shines in the conscience,
to warn us of sin, and the danger of transgression.
If therefore, we are not redeemed from immoral habits, and wrong conduct,
it is not from our being devoid of the means of redemption;
but from our impatience to decide and act,
before things have been sufficiently weighed in the cool,
calm stillness of the sanctuary, where the true balance is to be found,
and of which it is said that its "`just weight`" is the delight of the Lord.

=== CXXXIII

[quote.scripture, , Job 34:29]
____
When he gives quietness, who then can make trouble?
____

There are innumerable ways and means of obtaining temporary alleviation,
and short intervals of repose in times of trial;
but there is only one effectual and enduring comforter,
and only one method of obtaining his consolation;
and that is to wait patiently till it is his good pleasure to bestow it.
And think not the time long in which you seem to go comfortless,
for more is happening in these dreary times than you are able to imagine.
The helps and comforts which God bestows,
are not of the flimsy and fluctuating nature which characterize all merely human alleviations.
He prepares the soul by digging deep round about it with sharp exercises,
in order to prove the soundness and stability of its faith,
before he reveals to it the secret of his covenant mercies of life and peace.
When he finds it to stand fast in the truth, he comes in with his own gift of quietness,
and none can then trouble, or cause fear.

____
Let nothing be done through selfish ambition or conceit,
but in lowliness of mind let each esteem others better than himself.
Let each of you look out not only for his own interests,
but also for the interests of others.
____

It is a great and special favour when the precepts of the
gospel are early impressed upon the heart and conscience,
and in the season of youth, find a ready and practical reception.

But, for the most part, this is not the case.
The season of youth is too commonly, a season of vanity and self-will,
and highmindedness,
which leaves but little scope for the exercise of those divine
tempers which the Apostle here recommends as the Christian`'s duty.
It is after we have ourselves suffered, and been but too probably,
the cause of suffering to others,
from the lack of just those blessed tempers here spoken of,
that we become fully conscious of their exceeding beauty and value.
Happy is it for us,
if we labour to look with sympathetic kindness upon the things of others;
and "`in lowliness of mind to esteem others better than
ourselves,`" before we are driven by the pressure of adversity,
to learn this divine lesson.

=== CXXXV

[quote.scripture, , Psalm 19:14]
____
Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart, be acceptable in your sight,
O Lord, my strength and my Redeemer.
____

To walk as in the presence of God, is our only safeguard from sin and danger;
and in the prayer just quoted, we are taught how that is to be accomplished.
Thoughts and words must be closely watched,
in order to their appearing before the Lord in an acceptable form.
We can form no conception,
till we set ourselves to the work of interior observation and discipline,
how liable we are to let in a troop of robbers upon our minds, in the form of idle,
and often, of sinful imaginations.
We are told that "`the thought of foolishness is sin;`" but,
it is to be feared that few persons regard it in this light,
till indulged fancy has paved the way to evil deeds.
God has not left us defenceless;
for he has given a portion of his Holy Spirit to all his rational creatures;
and this divine teacher reveals to us what to follow, and what to shun,
in that kingdom of thought within us which is ever open to his view.

=== CXXXVI

[quote.scripture, , 2 Cor 8:12]
____
If there is first a willing mind, it is accepted according to what one has,
and not according to what he does not have.
____

The "`willing mind`" is all that is needful to render our religious services acceptable.
With respect to the external part of them, there is very little difficulty.
Nothing, for instance, is so easy as giving money; and consequently,
that is a branch of Christian duty which everybody sets themselves to the performance of,
whenever a rousing attack has been made upon the conscience.
But the Spirit which sanctifies deeds of charity,
the kindness of the "`willing mind,`" is a far deeper thing than mere almsgiving.
It diffuses a pleasure in the offering,
which has but a small and secondary reference to benevolence on the score of duty.
It is on the ground of love, that "`the willing mind`" acts.
No doubt,
the expression so continually in the mouth of foreign beggars when they ask charity,
"`_pour l`'amour du bon Dieu_`" +++[+++i.e. "`for the love of God`"],
is but a cant phrase with them; but in higher views, it is the right, true,
and sweet principle of all kind actions.

[quote.scripture, , Exodus 13:21]
____
And the Lord went before them by day in a pillar of cloud to lead the way,
and by night in a pillar of fire to give them light; so as to go by day and night.
____

We travel on briskly and cheerfully enough in our pilgrimage,
while light is beaming before us; but when a cloud comes over,
and there is nothing left for us to do, but to sit still and be patient,
we are apt to grow fretful and fearful, and full of despondency.
It is of the utmost importance to be prepared for this condition of mind,
by studying to acquire a habit of submission,
and of yielding ourselves implicitly to the will of Providence in dark and dismal times.
The Lord is with us in those dreary hours,
as surely as the tender parent is ever nearest to the sick one of the flock.
Joyous times have their own dangers,
for a great mixture of the fleshly nature is in them;
but in the exercise of patience and resignation, we resist, instead of indulge,
our animal spirits.

=== CXXXVIII

[quote.scripture, , Psalm 94:11]
____
The Lord knows the thoughts of man, that they are vanity.
____

Every act we engage in, has its beginning in the thoughts of the heart.
Nothing therefore, can be of so much importance to us,
as to be well acquainted with the nature of our thoughts; and to obey that true light,
which, through the conscience, reveals to us when they are of a vain and sinful kind,
and points to the duty of resisting them.
Forever study to feel this mighty Illuminator lifting up the holy mirror of Truth,
which in the glance of an instant,
discloses when evil and danger have entered the mind
in the form of vain and unholy thoughts.

Remember who it is "`that declares unto man what is his thought;
and treads upon the high places of the earth, the Lord,
the God of Hosts is his name`" Amos 4:13. Know this strong
Helper "`treading down`" those high places of your earth,
which are disclosed in your many vain, self-complacent, self-adorning thoughts.
Thankfully submit to the cleansing and exterminating
work upon all your idols which He will make of it;
and retain nothing but what is lovely, pure, and true, and such as He, by his Spirit,
witnesses to be "`lovely, and of good report.`"

=== CXXXIX

[quote.scripture, , Amos 5:15]
____
Hate the evil, and love the good; and establish judgment in the gate.
____

There is a point or centre in natural things,
towards which they are attracted as to their right and appointed place; as,
for instance the centre of gravity;--the point of sight, etc.
Just thus in spiritual things, there is a small, pure, exact centre towards which,
as towards Truth, they all tend.

This point of attraction is better _felt_ than defined;
and a faithful adherence to the light of life within,
can alone bring the soul into acquaintance with it.

As way-marks, one would say,
keep your inward eye observant of a certain gentle restraint, and drawing back,
upon the workings of your mind, when you are about to exceed in word or deed.
You will, at such times, be aware of an opposing force from the fleshly will,
which tends to create great confusion in your interior.
But that which is of the truth, and able to "`establish judgment`" in your spirit,
is invariably, quiet, meek, and pointing to a silence, which, if observed,
triumphs eventually, over all the noise and confusion of nature.

Good and upright is the Lord; therefore will he teach sinners in the way.
The meek will he guide in judgment, and the meek will he teach his way.
____

The life of God in the soul, is a life of meekness and love;
and just so much as we feel of this sweet humility and tenderness,
just so much do we know of the nature of God.
Come continually therefore,
to that which prepares your soul for the reception of his Holy Spirit,
and for the out-pouring of the stream of love which it is his blessed
nature to "`shed abroad`" in the hearts of those who truly turn to him.
This is the water of life which cleanses the soul
"`from all its filthiness and from all its idols.`"
These are the "`fresh springs,`" that send a gracious rain
upon the inheritance of the Lord in his creature`'s soul,
and which refresh it when it is weary.
Here is a little testimony I met with today in my reading,
which bears witness to the power of this living water.

____
The path of the just is as the shining light,

____

Whatever is of God in the soul,
is in direct antagonism to what is of the will of the flesh in the creature;
"`for the flesh lusts against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh;
and these are contrary the one to the other.`"
We must look therefore, for that which acts as a Restrainer,
rather than that which appears as a Propeller.
The eagerness of nature to grasp its objects, requires a perpetual check;
and we may venture to affirm that at the first impulse to action,
it stands in need of a very strict curb.

Never permit yourself to be hasty in rushing forth to the performance of your purposes,
no, not even your good purposes,
unless in such emergencies as may imperiously demand prompt measures.
In all cases that admit of it (and there are few which do not,) the path of the just,
is that of waiting upon the light of God`'s Spirit with humble patience,
until it has manifestly become the risen radiance of "`the perfect day.`"

____
Be therefore, followers of God as dear children; and walk in love,
as Christ also has loved us, and has given himself for us,
an offering and a sacrifice to God, for a sweet smelling savour.
____

Christ given _for us,_ is also Christ given _in us,_ as a Spirit of holy love;
and hence the Apostle elsewhere speaks of this mystery
as his first token of conversion to God.

"`When it pleased God,`" he says, "`to reveal his Son _in me,_
I conferred not with flesh and blood.`"

"`To walk in love,`" and to be "`followers of God
as dear children,`" is to perceive and to understand,
the revelation of his blessed Son _in us._
Do you inquire how this revelation manifests itself?
The answer is, in the change, or conversion from darkness to light,
and from evil to good, which then pervades the creature`'s interior kingdom.
He feels within him, the motions of a gentle, meek, and lowly Spirit,
even that Spirit of the Son,
which the Father sends into the hearts of those who
desire to turn from the error of their ways,
and "`as dear children to become followers of God.`"
In a word, he feels a holy Spirit of adoption sealing him a child of God,
and prompting the blessed cry of "`Abba Father!`"

And the living creatures ran, and returned, as the appearance of a flash of lightning.
____

We lose much of the amazing power of many of the mystical
passages in the Scriptures of the Old Testament,
from the difficulty of translating them into intelligible terms.
But in such representations of divine things, as this symbolical language enfolds,
none but the true Interpreter--even the Spirit of the Lord, can be the Commentator.

I believe that it was under the teaching of this Spirit, I was this day,
while musing on this passage, made to perceive,
that I was never to reason about what seemed to be divine openings;
but to be meekly attentive and receptive of light;
so that when the Wonderful Illuminator passed by in His chariot of fire,
His vivid enlightenings might find entrance in my soul.
Evermore also, I saw, that I must stop when He stopped;
and seek to understand nothing but as in the flash of His light
He showed it to me--when His word was "`running swiftly.`"

Prize as the apple of your eye,
all those feelings which make you satisfied and glad that God should "`search you out,
and know you, and understand your thought, and be acquainted with all your ways.`"
The heart is in its right state when this is its condition;
and that it may be preserved in it,
observe to deal most closely and unsparingly with yourself
by bringing every thought to the witness in your conscience,
whose role it is to judge your cause, and before whom you are continually to spread it.
This is the only possible way in which to know yourself aright,
and to obtain any insight into the strength and multitude of your "`secret faults.`"
"`Who can understand his errors?`"
Nobody living.
We can form no conception of our self-love and self-idolatry,
but as the Holy Spirit of Truth reveals them to us.
It is thus only, we come to self-knowledge,

____
According to your lovingkindness; according unto the multitude of your tender mercies,

____

God manifests His love towards us in admonishing us by the rebukes of His Holy Spirit.
Ever regard them as tokens of those "`tender mercies`" which would save you from evil,
and lead you in a safe and good path,
provided you are willing to _be_ saved and rightly guided.
_His_ tender mercies are mercies indeed; but "`the tender mercies of the wicked are cruel.`"
Such are the mercies of the world, the flesh, and the devil;
which would always be prompting you to indulge and caress the will and wishes of nature.

Oh, forever distrust and denounce such mercies as these!
Keep near to that which detects, and judges down, the puerile,
enervating character of them.
"`Endure hardship,`" endure everything that calls for fortitude;

It is a great matter to be able sincerely and constantly to give up ourselves unto God.
Religiously disposed persons are often in great darkness
as to the real state of their faith.
They are so much in the habit of looking to external helps, such as sermons,
church going, and the opinions of the persons with whom they associate,
and depending upon these for comfort and direction,
that they seldom perceive that while settling here,
they are making no advance in faith in God.
They are believing in people, and in means;
but not in that inward communion with God in their own hearts,
which is the only possible way whereby they can come
to such a living acquaintance with Him,
as will enable them, in the full assurance of faith, to give themselves wholly up to Him.
It is well said by an old writer,
"`live with God as if there were nothing but your soul and Him in the universe.`"
In fact there _is_ nothing else, as far as your destiny forever and ever is concerned.

Everything that unfits us for suffering our allotted trials with patience, and hope,
and courage, is an unsafe thing, and the less we have to do with it the better.
All self-indulgence has a tendency to enervate the soul,
and to render it unfit for encountering affliction,
or for supporting the exigencies of human life, in a way to benefit by them.
All self-denial, on the contrary, has a secret virtue hidden in it, which quietly,
and imperceptibly, administers moral health and strength,
just as a medicine gradually restores the body to vigour and tone,
when it has been weakened by illness.
Constantly therefore,
endeavour to resist those things which gratify nature in any undue and unusual measure.
When we are really sincere in desiring to be redeemed from evil, and sanctified unto God,
he is faithful in helping us by the course of his Providence,
to more restraints than indulgences, and thus keeping us in sound moral health.

Love is joy, and the only pure joy.
All other joys are mere vanity and lies; dreams of the senses, and things of nought;
belonging to the animal, partaking of the selfish, unholy nature of the animal,
and passing away with the transitory life of the animal.
But divine love,
the word "`the Christ of God,`" what tongue shall speak
of its all-satisfying--all-glorious--all-rapturous nature!
A soul in passing from this wretched world into the bosom of that love,
once said some memorable words respecting it.
Here are a few of them.

There is a Spirit which I feel, that delights to do no evil, nor to revenge any wrong;
but delights to endure all things, in hope to enjoy its own in the end.
Its hope is to outlive all wrath and contention,
and to weary out all exaltation and cruelty,
or whatsoever is of a nature that is contrary to itself.
It sees to the end of all temptations.
As it bears no evil in itself, so it conceives none in thought to any other.
If it be betrayed, it bears it;
for its ground and spring is the mercy and forgiveness of God.
Its crown is meekness, its life is everlasting love unfeigned,
and it never rejoices but through suffering.^

This is the way to come to pure, living knowledge of divine things.
Reading is good,
and all means of an external kind that help the soul to knowledge are valuable,
and to be used in their time and place.
But this exercise of obedient, interior watchfulness, is good for all times,

If, then, you desire to know in whom you have believed,
and what he is both able and willing to do in "`cleansing the thoughts

steadily a habit of "`standing on your rampart,`" and observe from
there how your mind is drawn away from all sin and folly,
and strengthened to abide under the power of every good thought and feeling.
In this retired and quiet condition of your inner man, you will be able to understand,
in a way quite inconceivable to you before you enter upon such an exercise,

What a concise, simple,
and beautiful picture does this verse of holy Writ
exhibit of the sincere servant of the Lord!
Yet surely, it is one not beyond the power of every holy minded person to understand.
The law of truth is as near to us as the law of sin;
and greater is he that is in us as a conquerer of iniquity,
than he that prompts to the commission of it.
It is unquestionably,
of great importance that we should put no confidence in our own strength;
but it is equally important we should estimate as all-sufficient,
the strength which God by his Spirit is ever ready to impart to us; and helped by which,
we may confidently hope to "`walk with him in peace and equity,`"
and to be holding forth by our example so earnest and consistent
a course of conduct and of respect for the law of Truth,
that we may be the means of "`turning many away from iniquity.`"

To have a house, or habitation of the Spirit, built and established by understanding,
and to be the wise man who is strong, and the man of knowledge who increases strength,
is to be in a blessed condition; but alas, far different is the real state of man.
Fear and weakness prevailing in times of trial, recklessness, and boldness,
when trial is unknown, filled with ups and downs, and extremes and exaggeration,
nothing is stable, nothing is _built,_ in the condition of the natural man.
Come away then, from this fitful nature of the carnal mind.
Come to that which builds and establishes you upon the spiritual and unchangeable.

It is observed by some writer, but I forget at this moment whom,

Nothing certainly would be so astonishing, and altogether so painful,

sparing of words, and never disposed to use them in a way of argumentation.
He sees things with, and by, the guidance of the divine eye here spoken of;
and thus he is able to comprehend in the light of the moment,
what that moment reveals in the way of duty; and this far quicker,
and with much more clearness and precision, than any words could describe it.
He is disturbed and confused by words,
and feels himself constantly withdrawn from using them in a way
of doubting or disputing as to the way in which he is to walk,
in order to become acquainted with the nature of God.
When he does not clearly perceive his path, he remains motionless,

The temperament of human beings is of a mixed character; but in general,
it will be found, that one quality of an evil kind predominates, and,
in some modification or another, forms the besetting sin of the individual;
that bosom foe which requires to be continually resisted,
and from which the grace of God can alone redeem the soul.

And I believe, if we consider the subject with due attention,
we shall discover that those prevailing iniquities may, for the most part,
be classed under the head of deceit and violence, or hypocrisy and wrath.
The person whose temptation is that of deceit, is seldom the victim of violent temper;
and the hasty, impetuous, irritable individual,
is not usually assaulted with temptations to craft and subtlety.

Either evil propensity is a grievous burden,
and cannot but be felt as such by the subject of it.
How strengthening then is the promise which inspires
a hope of redemption at the hand of God,
from "`the sin which does most easily beset us!`"

"`to whom we are to come as to a _living_ stone.`"
We may rest assured, that if we desire to benefit by our religious profession,
it is incumbent on us to keep our mind in fresh, green, and living pastures.
This is a difficult process,--so prone is nature to be
eating of the food of dead remembrances,--and
so painful is the effort that would sever us from what seems so harmless an indulgence.
But it is unwholesome provender; and if we would enjoy spiritual health,
we must renounce it.
We must keep progressing,--and _let go_ of all those profitless
memories which lead us to "`lodge in the monuments,

"`Look not at pleasures as they come,

Look not at any enticing object while it presents its pleasant side;

Look at it as it will seem to you when novelty is over, and the will is gratified.
By accustoming the mind to this discipline,
it will be able to penetrate beyond the surface of things,
and to discern what consequences are concealed beneath their outward semblance.
Everything has its price, and self-indulgence is the most costly thing in the world,
being totally insatiable.
What it wants today, it will still more imperatively demand tomorrow:
and in the meantime, by yielding to its clamour,
the priceless value of self-respect and self-government are forfeited,
and the paltry spectacle of one who cannot say "`NO`"
to himself is exhibited in their stead.

[quote.scripture, , Romans 12:21]
____
Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good.
____

This is the universal panacea for every ill, the right, true,
and God-like way of passing through the world, so as to be ourselves the better,
and to render all connected with us the better, for our having had a place in it.
But, unhappily, we are a long time in learning this divine lesson,
which teaches us the proper way of overcoming evil,
that fearful destroyer which crosses our path so perpetually.

The young have no experience, and can put faith in nothing but the present hour,
and the indulgence to will and wish with which it can supply them.
They overcome nothing upon the principle of duty or wisdom; but only on that of necessity.
And, with respect to the aged, if they are less arrogant and self-willed,
it is too often from weariness and incapacity to resist,
than from any higher motive that they seem placable and submissive.
The good which overcomes evil, must be sought where alone it can be found;
and that is in the renewal of the heart by the Spirit of God.

=== CLVIII

[quote.scripture, , Isaiah 57:16]
____
For I will not contend forever, neither will I be always wroth;
for the spirit should fail before me, and the souls which I have made.
____

Whatever you follow in the way of religious profession,
be careful never to take up with any ideas of God,
but those which represent him to you as the Fountain of
all goodness--all mercy--all forgiveness--all love.
There are Scriptures, no doubt, that speak of his wrath;
but there are none that represent him as otherwise than ready to pity,
and to help the creatures of his hand.

Leave everything that terrifies, when you draw near to your heavenly Father.
He knows your condition better than you can tell it to him,
and what is needful for its amelioration and encouragement.
Let it be as bad as it may,
it can never be beyond his power and will to renew and change it.
Take hold of the blessed word of promise given you here:
and plead it earnestly before him;
and rest assured that you can never plead it in vain with him who delights in mercy,
and who abundantly pardons the repentant prodigal.

[quote.scripture, , Proverbs 12:20]
____
To the counsellors of peace is joy.
____

Endeavour, as much as possible, to maintain the exercise of kind and peaceful feelings.
It is assuredly a difficult matter to do so in a nature where there is so much bitterness,
and so many things to excite evil tempers.
But this poor human nature of ours must be always regarded, and treated,
as a diseased and morbid condition of being;
and not by any means as our right and healthy state;
and the remedy to which it must be constantly subjugated, is LOVE.
And bear in mind that it is not a narrow, insulated,
selfish love for particular persons that are agreeable to us that will renovate us;
but a broad, universal, forbearing, compassionate, considerate love for everybody.

And sure may you be,
that everybody requires to be regarded with this large heart of love;
for everybody that lives, has to die, and to suffer, and to bear as best he may,
his portion of sorrow; and well it befits his fellow sufferer, and fellow sinner,
to sympathize with him.

=== CLX

[quote.scripture, , Jeremiah 31:14]
____
And my people shall be satisfied with my goodness, says the Lord.
____

We are forever yearning after happiness, yet know not where to look for it.
The earthly nature, indeed, is at no loss where to turn for its food,
for there is no lack of the provender which it loves, wherever it roves.

But it is food which is of its own life and likeness,
and feeds and nourishes that which prevents the growth
of another and a better nature in the soul.

"`Must I then be always restrained?`"--inquires the strong will.
"`Am I to know no indulgence?`"
Alas, how long, and how severely must the check be applied,
before we perceive how good it is for us to bear the yoke
which holds in submission the constant restlessness of nature.
Great need have we, again and again,
to contemplate the benefits which this restraint produces.
And they are manifold, steadfast, and precious; but they may be consolidated in one word,
they lead to _satisfaction,_ because they lead to God,
the only true and real source of rest and peace to the soul which he has made.
"`My people shall be satisfied with my goodness,`" says the Lord.
Oh my soul, forever and forever let your response be, AMEN! "`Even so Father,
for so it seems good in your sight!`"

=== CLXI

[quote.scripture, , 2 Tim. 1:7]
____
For God has not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of love,
and of a sound mind.
____

Here is a compendium of what it is the design of God to bless us with.
And, can we desire any gifts so well fitted to make us happy here,
and to prepare us for everlasting happiness hereafter, as deliverance from fear,
the strongest and most distressing, but at the same time,
one of the most natural emotions of creatures so frail and feeble as we are,
and situated in the midst of mysteries so calculated to
appall us as are the strange enigmas of life and death,
and evil and good?
What could be so divine to possess, as power to act as becomes a rational being,
and love to adorn us with moral beauty, and a sound mind,
to lift us out of sin and folly?

Here, then, is the testimony of what our religion is to do,
in making us what God would have us to be.

Are we fearful, and doubtful, and running to brother or to neighbour,
to ask their aid in ascertaining our spiritual condition?
Or, do we know it as one which God has delivered from fear,
and blessed with the Spirit "`of power, and of love, and of a sound mind?`"

=== CLXII

[quote.scripture, , Psalm 143:10]
____
Teach me to do your will, for you are my God; your Spirit is good;
lead me into the land of uprightness.
____

It will be found a great help to self-government, and interior peace,
always to remember that we have two natures.
In fact, we may look upon ourselves as composed of two individualities;
one which is of the earth, earthy; and the other,
the "`new creature`" born of the Spirit, belonging to another nature,
and dwelling in another land,--the land of uprightness.
And it is for the advancement of this new and holy life,
that the prayers of the Psalmist are so often breathed forth.
They are, in fact,
the tender yearnings of the holy child itself;--the outgoings of the young heavenly
heart which ever pants for union and communion with the source of its existence.
Oh, muse awhile upon the longings which it here gives forth!
How pure, how earnest, how full of divine desire are they!
Teach me to do your will; for you are my God: your Spirit is good;
lead me "`into the land of uprightness!`"

=== CLXIII

[quote.scripture, , Psalm 34:22]
____
The Lord redeems the soul of his servants,
and none of them that trust in him shall be desolate.
____

We live in a dream, till some stroke of sorrow awakens us.
Nothing more strongly testifies to this unconsciousness of our real state,
than the total ignorance we are in concerning the lonely condition of our souls.
Sudden fear, and the desolation of the wicked,
we hear of as things with which we have no concern.
We hope we are not to be classed with the wicked,
and therefore we see no cause for sudden fear; and as for desolation,
we do not know what it means.
But, let sickness or the prospect of death overtake us,
and then we feel what is meant by that word,
"`fearfulness and trembling have come upon me, and a horrible dread has overwhelmed me.`"
This is the universal cry of humanity;
for the terrors of death must be felt at some time, and in some measure by everyone;
but this blessed word of promise will stand sure through
it all--that "`none of those who trust in God shall be desolate.`"

=== CLXIV

[quote.scripture, , Exodus 16:14]
____
And when the layer of dew lifted, there, on the surface of the wilderness,
was a small round substance, as fine as frost on the ground.
____

And Moses said, "`this is the bread which the Lord has given you to eat.`"
The bread of truth is much too small, and lowly, and simple,
for the corrupt will of nature to relish; and therefore is it spurned, and the cry,
as with the Israelites, is still, "`give us flesh,
for our soul loathes this light food.`"
But heed not this clamour and rage of the carnal mind;
but eat your simple food in the duties of the day and hour,
always with contented patience,
if you cannot make it altogether "`gladness and singleness of heart.`"
Do nothing, and as much as possible think of nothing,
while the "`dew lies all around the camp;`" that is to say,
while the mist and obscurity raised by confused thoughts and feelings is present.
Wait for their clearing off;
and then keep close to the little "`round substance,`" the perfect,
compact seed of truth, which lies in the small moment before you; and to feed on which,
you must stoop low, and keep low, and "`let your eyes look straight before you.`"

=== CLXV

[quote.scripture, , Hosea 13:6-8]
____
When they had pasture, they were filled; they were filled and their heart was exalted;
therefore they forgot me.
So I will be to them like a lion; like a leopard by the road I will lurk;
I will meet them like a bear deprived of her cubs; I will tear open their rib cage.
____

Most terrible is commonly the reaction, when, after a course of self-indulgence,
the soul is brought into contest with adversity.
If it be only as a matter of prudence, and in order to be prepared for vicissitudes,
it is wise to _live low,_ and by living low,
to keep down that exaltation of nature which is _sure_
to bring severe humiliation in its train.

"`The Lord preserves the simple.`"
"`When Israel was a child I loved him.`"
Aim to be ever this little child,
contented with what the Father gives of pleasure or of play:
and when restrained from either play or pleasure,
and led for a season into the chamber of sorrow, rest quiet on His bosom, and smile,
and be patient, as one nestled in a sweet and most secure asylum.

=== CLXVI

[quote.scripture, , Ezekiel 18:25]
____
Is not my way equal?
Are not your ways unequal?
____

There is no peace where there is no equilibrium; and hence,
the ways of the human being are commonly such as lead to disquietude,
by their disorder and inequality.
No stable happiness is possible, till the nature is rectified.
Now, if we had not the testimony of revelation to guide us to the knowledge
of the means requisite to produce the required rectification,
we might, by arguing from analogy, be sure that they must be within our reach:
the wisdom of God, as displayed in the creation,
allotting to every creature whatever is indispensable to its well being,
in the place and condition which He has assigned it.
Quite certain, therefore, may we be,
that He has placed near us something that is fitted and designed
to balance and keep in equilibrium the various forces of our nature;
and that this is to be sought, and will be found,
in the righteous law which he writes upon the conscience; and which, as it is obeyed,
regulates the soul with a sense of _the equality_ of the way of the Lord.

=== CLXVII

[quote.scripture, , Psalm 37:19]
____
They shall not be ashamed in the evil time,
and in the days of famine they shall be satisfied.
____

There are evil times in store for everybody;
and days when there is a famine in their land, even of that "`savoury food`" which,
in the indulgence of the senses, and of the promptings of the will,
the fleshly mind loves, and for which it is perpetually hunting.
Sickness, the loss of friends, or of wealth, disappointment, in short,
in some form or another, brings a time of dearth upon all our pleasures;
and unless there be something better than the world has to bestow,
for the bereaved soul to fall back upon,
it may in truth be said to be ashamed of the poverty and insufficiency of its condition.
But it is not so with the servant of the Lord.
Affliction is his time of affluence; for, although _in_ the world, he is not of it;
and consequently,
his spirit finds its most perfect level when brought into circumstances which tend to
replenish him with a more than common supply of the riches of divine grace.

=== CLXVIII

[quote.scripture, , Hosea 13:5]
____
I did know you in the wilderness, in the land of great drought.
____

We cannot go two ways at once; neither can we serve and please the flesh,
and at the same time expect to taste of the joys of the Spirit;
"`for these are contrary the one to the other;`" and if
we really desire to come under the teaching of God,
we shall soon find that He will not "`let us do the thing that we would.`"
He "`sends a drought upon the waters of Babylon,`" and makes us to have
a living acquaintance with that word of rebuke to the fleshly mind,
"`O, you that dwell upon many waters, abundant in treasures, your end is come,
and the measure of your covetousness!`"
He hedges up the way with thorns, so that we shall not find our paths.
He strips us bare, and "`slays us with thirst.`"
And why?
Because, seeing our danger, helplessness, and folly, he takes us out of our own keeping,
does that for us which must be done, in cleansing us from our pollutions, and idols,
and lying vanities, and then "`knows us,`" that is, reveals himself to us as our Helper,
Saviour, and Comforter, "`in the land of great drought.`"

=== CLXIX

[quote.scripture, , Isaiah 52:1-2]
____
Awake, awake; put on your strength, O Zion: put on your beautiful garments, O Jerusalem,
the holy city; for henceforth, there shall no more come into you,
the uncircumcised and the unclean.
Shake yourself from the dust: arise, and sit down, O Jerusalem;
loose yourself from the bands of your neck, O captive daughter of Zion.
____

We may trace through the sublime obscurity of these mystical words,
a glorious and delightful interpretation,
and one that is of individual application to the soul;
which the Holy Spirit here calls upon to awake from the death-like sleep of the fleshly,
to put on the strength of the divine nature,
and to clothe itself with the beautiful garments of righteousness and truth,
which are its proper raiment,
and which are not to be defiled by contact with any unholy thing.
It is a command that goes forth for you to "`shake
yourself`" from the dust of the earthly nature;
to arise and depart therefrom,
and having loosed yourself from the bonds and fetters of corruption,
to sit down in heavenly places "`with God`'s dear Son.`"

=== CLXX

[quote.scripture, , Galatians 4:6]
____
And because you are sons, God has sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts,
crying, Abba Father!
____

Wherever there is life, it acts according to the nature of life; that is to say,
freely and spontaneously.
A child does not need to be managed with any contrivance,
in order that it may desire the sustenance of the mother`'s breast;
nor taught how to make known its needs by cries.
It testifies its needs instinctively.
In like manner,
the holy child of the regenerate birth instinctively hungers after its proper nourishment,
and seeks its food from God, in the breathings of its heart for his love and favour.
"`Abba Father!`"--how natural and how sweet is this appeal!
How replete with the need of the creature, and the fulness of the Creator!
O, nourish this tender yearning,--this meek supplication,
so concise yet so infinitely comprehensive! "`Abba Father!`"
Plead this blessed relationship before the tender parent of the universe;
who hears and answers the desire of every living thing;
and more especially the desires of his own children.

=== CLXXI

[quote.scripture, , Isaiah 28:13]
____
The word of the Lord was unto them precept upon precept, precept upon precept;
line upon line, line upon line; here a little, and there a little; that they might go,
and fall backward, and be broken, and snared, and taken.
____

We would have the work of regeneration done in one stroke.
But this is not God`'s way of acting.
Be patient, tried and anxious soul: have _great_ patience with yourself,
for you little know how much there is to pull down before the new building can be raised.
Clearly indeed, and with the most perfect approval, may the right way be perceived,
before the will is sufficiently subdued to walk in it obediently.
In this unbroken state, the word of the Lord must come to it again and again,
"`here a little, and there a little;`" till, by degrees,
its enemies are made to fall backwards, and be snared, and taken.
Only be steadfast in keeping the ground already obtained.
The Lord "`knows the way you take;`" and when He has sufficiently tried you,
"`you will come forth as gold.`"

=== CLXXII

[quote.scripture, , Job 23:11]
____
My foot has held his steps: his way have I kept, and not declined.
____

Assuredly, there is a sense of the presence of Truth and of God,
to be ascertained in the soul, when it is brought to a stand, and dwells in stillness;
and as this state of equilibrium is maintained,
we come into the condition spoken of in the text, as "`holding the steps of God.`"
In other words, the soul moves as he moves,
and has an experience that "`righteousness shall go before him,
and shall set us in the direction of his steps.`"^
footnote:[Psalm 85:13]
"`This is the rest wherewith you may cause the weary to rest,
and this is the refreshing.`"
But it is only too easy to _decline_ from this blessed state; for, as says the prophet,
"`this people is backslidden by a perpetual backsliding.`"
Indeed, it is impossible to prevent this, without extreme and constant watchfulness.
So inconceivably sudden are the electric movements of the mind, that before we are aware,
we find ourselves uncentred and broken from our anchorage.
The foot no longer stands in the "`even place;`"
no longer "`holds the steps of God,`" but declines,
backslides, and all the work has again to be begun.
"`Oh for patience and perseverance!`"--is all that we can say.

=== CLXXIII

[quote.scripture, , Jer. 31:4]
____
Again I will build you, and you shall be built, O virgin of Israel.
____

Nothing builds, nothing heals and restores, nothing supports and comforts the soul,
but right views of the nature of God.
And what is this nature?
Love--"`God is Love!`"
Just that which poor, fallen human nature needs, but has not.
Oh for a touch, a glimpse of this divine, sweet, and patient love,
this tender mercy which is never weary of blessing, and of doing good!
The blind and ignorant sinner says in his haste, "`all men are liars!`"
Yes, he thinks sometimes that God Himself deceives; and then, with futile desperation,
he rushes upon self-indulgence,
and pulls down whatever good the blessed Spirit of the Lord might,
in more favourable times, have built in his soul.
But still this loving Lord is not to be discouraged.
He _waits_ to be gracious.
He takes advantage, so to speak, of every opening,
to come in with the healing balm of his salvation.
The willful creature may pull down his dwelling; but,
as a bird despoiled by cruel boys of her nest, patiently sets herself to build another,
so does the patient Lord of love, again and again,
seek to build himself a habitation in the soul of man.
"`Again I will build you, and you shall be built, O virgin of Israel.`"

=== CLXXIV

[quote.scripture, , Nahum 3:4]
____
The mistress of witchcraft...
____

There is a divine Spirit, pure, simple, single;
and all that is of this Spirit is redeeming, saving, cleansing,
and restoring in its nature.
It leads away from all self-indulgence,
and the delusive beauty of the delectable things of earth.
This Spirit is typified in Scripture by the New Jerusalem, Zion, etc.

There is also a spirit too near to us, which is one with the world, and with the flesh;
yet most bland and beautiful to the senses.
This is figured in Holy Writ by Babylon, "`the mistress of witchcrafts.`"
Forever keep aloof from it.

Beware, also, of another false spirit,
which suddenly and vehemently suggests such and such a course of action as right,
but which, when entered upon, proves to have been erroneous.

All hurry, and confusion, and multiplicity, and eagerness to act,
arise from the promptings of this spirit.
Always mistrust the impulse that urges you to hasten into action.
Whatever is from the right source can afford to wait,
and will gather strength and clearness _from_ waiting.
Evil spirits are always vehement and hasty spirits;
therefore keep close to that which can wait, and be patient,
and forego the suggestions of everything that is vehement, and in a hurry to be doing.
It was common to hear Lavater say, "`_I can wait._`"
"`This,`" says Mr. Cecil, "`is a vast attainment!`"

=== CLXXV

[quote.scripture, , Psalm 26:12]
____
My foot stands in an even place.
____

It is wonderful what light we shall obtain from many passages of Scripture,
by regarding them as enfolding in the oriental mode of parable, and figures of speech,
some great truth.
Much of the closest and most valuable instruction
of Holy Writ is expressed in this manner.
The imagery here is deeply suggestive of divine counsel.

"`My foot stands in an even place;`" that is to say, the wandering mind,
which in its natural state, is never at rest or at home,
when subdued by the grace of God no longer strays in dangerous paths,
but stands in "`an even place.`"
And to this place of rest we must be brought,
if we desire to dwell near our faithful Shepherd.
Feel after this interior evenness--this perfect balance of soul; and be assured that,
making it a daily exercise to do so, in great quietness and retirement of mind,
you will get to a keenness of spiritual discernment which
will enable you to understand what David meant when he said,
"`I have more understanding than my teachers.`"

=== CLXXVI

[quote.scripture, , 1 John 2:27]
____
But the anointing you have received of him, abides in you,
and you need not that any man teach you; but,
as the same anointing teaches you of all things, and is truth, and is no lie,
and even as it has taught you, you shall abide in him.
____

Our religion does next to nothing for us,
unless it gives us in the depths of our own souls a sense of sureness
with respect to the ground and object of our religious faith and hope.
I do not say that we may not be greatly helped, and much refreshed,
by communion with sincerely pious people,
and by the ministration which it may be granted them to extend to us.
But these are things of times and occasions that may, or may not, fall in our way.
That with which we must abide, and which must be present to us at all times,
and in all circumstances, is the great point for us to understand;
and this it is to which this Scripture calls our attention,
even to "`the anointing`"--or to that measure of the Holy Spirit which we have received,
and through whose aid we are to be rightly instructed in all things,
so that "`we need not that any man should teach us.`"

=== CLXXVII

[quote.scripture, , Eccles. 8:11]
____
Because the sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily,
therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil.
____

Without giving ourselves up willfully and consciously to the commission of evil,
we may yet be in great danger of having our hearts set upon pursuing our own way; which,
unless it be one that is rectified by acquaintance with, and submission to,
the way of the Lord, cannot be otherwise than an ignorant, and, in all likelihood,
an evil way.
Eschew most earnestly,
that delusive notion which so easily obtains an entrance into the mind, that,
because you have hitherto met with no check,
no interruption in a particular course of life, which may be,
in some important respects, a questionable one,
there is ground to think it a safe and allowable course.

Nothing is allowable as to your moral condition,
which admits of being the subject of different opinions.
Never admit a query, where the mere making of a query argues lukewarmness,
if nothing worse, in the cause of God and Truth.

=== CLXXVIII

[quote.scripture, , Philippians 1:9-10]
____
And this I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more, in knowledge,
and in all judgment; that you may approve things that are excellent;
that you may be sincere, and without offence, till the day of Christ.
____

It is at all times essential to the well-being of the rational creature,
that he should have "`a right judgment in all things.`"
But truly, in the times in which we live,
so manifold and so violent are the excitements which surround us,
and so near and so dangerous the facilities for yielding
to the impulses attendant on those excitements,
that there seems augmented reasons for making this supplication of the Apostle,
especially our own.

Watch closely in all things, you,
who desire to be on the Lord`'s side in this day of danger--this day of highmindedness,
when the language of the heart is virtually, with the larger part of mankind,
"`our lips are our own, who is Lord over us?`"
Watch and pray, that you may approve things that are excellent,
and "`that you may abound more and more in knowledge,
and in all judgment;`" and ever remember, that the condition of mind which God favours,
is one of exceeding meekness and humility.
"`Learn of me, for I am meek and lowly in heart,`" is the language of his Holy Spirit.

=== CLXXIX

[quote.scripture, , Psalm 146:7-8]
____
The Lord looses the prisoners; the Lord opens the eyes of the blind.
____

A prison house filled with captives is the earthly nature;
and while the soul is held in bondage there,
it is in a state of thick darkness "`that may be felt.`"
It inhabits a low dungeon where it "`sinks in deep mire, and finds no standing.`"
It is a great matter to understand and distinguish this state,
from that into which the Spirit of Truth guides the soul;
and to keep close to the enlightened eye which detects the
rapid and delicate gleams that reveal the right path.
We have a deceiving nature in us, and an arch deceiver that works in that nature;
and it is very easy to be deluded, and to boast with the Jews of old,
that "`we never were in bondage,`" when we are "`tied
and bound by the chain of our sins.`"
In order to be loosened from this chain, we should observe,
and obey the smallest motions of the heavenly Guide, which are always minute and brief;
"`here a little, and there a little.`"
Gentle and meek, and never prompting to act by fits and starts,
as the impulses of nature so commonly do, we may only too easily lose its blessed aid,
unless we are "`steadfast and immoveable`" in watching for its appearance.

____
Wherefore laying aside all malice, and all guile, and hypocrisies, and envies,
and evil speaking; as newborn babes, desire the sincere milk of the word,
that you may grow thereby.
____

Divine Father, whose nature and whose name is love, be pleased to help me, your poor,
ignorant, and fallen creature, to fulfill the blessed counsel here extended to me!
I would lay aside the malice, the guile, the hypocrisies, the envyings,
and the evil speaking of my fleshly nature; and with the instinct of a newborn babe,
desire the sweetness, and the purity of the living Word of Truth,
that I might grow thereby into the life and likeness of your own child.

But O, my heavenly Father, you that know all things,
do see how many there be in my own nature of sin and self-hood,
that fight against these holy longings of the better part.
Be my helper in this conflict, and for the honour of your holy name,
"`bring forth judgment unto victory,`" now and forevermore.
Amen!

[quote.scripture, , 1 Cor. 7:32]
____
But I want you to be without care.
____

It is extremely difficult not to swerve into one or the other extreme of too much,
or too little care, in the necessary duties and occupations of life.
Some persons are so acutely sensitive,
as to find a source of anxiety in everything that befalls them.
It is on the side of too tight a grasp of earthly things,
and the hopes and fears which these excite, that danger and distress commonly arise;
and it is only in the exercise of religious restraint upon all the excesses of
feeling that we can hope to attain to the condition which the Apostle here specifies,
as that which he desired for his disciples.

To be "`without care,`" is to be without that restless glance towards results,
which is a great hindrance not only to present peace,
but also to the performance of present duty.
When you have taken such measures respecting any matter as appear to be right,
endeavour to put it as much as possible from your thoughts.
This demands severe exertion; but it is labour which will amply repay you,
in the exemption from excessive care which it will produce.

=== CLXXXII

[quote.scripture, , Proverbs 29:23]
____
A man`'s pride shall bring him low; but honour shall uphold the humble in spirit.
____

Nothing but the grace of God can make any person really humble.
There is a timidity of nature,
and there is a buoyancy and placidity of temper (often
arising from insensibility) in some persons,
which is sometimes mistaken for humility; but it is a mere semblance,
and when brought to the test, a very poor one, of that divine grace.
Nothing is so inconceivably rare, as genuine lowliness of mind;
and never can it be obtained, but through long and deep exercises of soul.
Pride belongs in some measure, and usually a very large one, to everybody.
It is so much a part of us, and so constant a modification of our self-love,
that in order to subdue it, we usually have again and again to experience,
by the manifold mortifications it procures, that it does indeed, "`bring us low.`"

The subjugation of our pride is, in fact,
one of the severest means of discipline in the school where the Lord teaches.
Under the wholesome rod of His correction,
we gradually discover it to be the bosom sin against which His hand is ever lifted up;
and which must be made a whole burnt offering unto Him,
before honour shall uphold us in humility of spirit.

=== CLXXXIII

[quote.scripture, , Psalm 17:2]
____
Let my judgment come forth from your presence; let your eyes look with equity.
____

Keep as much as possible to that restraining principle
which stays and equalizes your mind;
for you cannot too often, nor too vividly, remember,
that the one great matter is to obtain the mastery over yourself,
and never to be wasted and desolated by your own will.

How futile and childish is the impotent condition which attends the yielding to impulse,
and which keeps the mind perpetually oscillating from this to that,
unequal--unbalanced--unbuilt.
Stand aloof from all that leads into this fractional, uncentred state.
Bear in stillness and patience, the "`pelting of the pitiless storm`" of the passions;
bowing your head meekly beneath the coming billows.
Be assured,
that no sentence from the calm and wise Spirit of the Lord
can be obtained while you are under any excitement.
It is when all is at peace, and in a state of equilibrium in your soul,
and _there_ the eyes of the Lord "`look with equity,`" that decisions come
forth from His presence which are to guide and regulate your conduct.

Wisdom is better than strength.
____

There is such an omnipotence in the will, or rather there seems to be,
that we often fancy that we have only to say "`_I will_`" or "`_I
will not,_`" and the matter which troubles us will be disposed of.

But this haste and arrogance in attempting to dispose of things, has,
in its very vehemence, the elements of waste and impotence.
It is a mere flash in the pan, and does nothing but make a noise.
That which really effects a result, and brings forth fruit that remains,
is a very different, and a far nobler thing.
It is wisdom, not will--not man`'s will at least, but the Lord`'s;
and wisdom when of the kind "`that comes down from above,`" is the meekest and quietest,
but at the same time the most powerful of all agents.
But, how much must be endured, how much resigned,
before the violent and disorderly workings of nature are
sufficiently subdued for wisdom`'s gentle voice to be heard!
For truly is it said, that "`the words of the wise are heard in quiet.`"
Cultivate therefore, assiduously this inward peace,
that wisdom may arise and rule within you,
and be found better than any of the strength which nature has to bestow.

Endure hardship, as a good soldier of Jesus Christ.
____

This advice of the Apostle to his young disciple, is needful to us all;
for to all of us the necessity for enduring hardship, in some shape or another,
will be sure to arrive.
The warfare which we have to maintain in the contest between flesh and Spirit,
calls upon us to endure, and to "`be strong in the grace which is in Christ Jesus.`"
This painful conflict is the criterion of our sincerity,
and of our having actually entered upon the condition of a soldier of Jesus Christ.

For, it is one thing, and a very easy thing, to acquire a knowledge of doctrine,
and to be an expert in quoting Scriptures to support it; and another,
and a very difficult thing, to war a good warfare,
in the resistance of vain and sinful imaginations,
and the pulling down of the strongholds of pride and covetousness,
and bringing every thought into captivity which exalts
itself against the knowledge of God;
and thus, perfecting in our souls obedience to the law of Christ.

I have chosen the way of truth, your judgments have I laid before me.
____

It is a great gift to possess a love of truth; so that by choice, and desire,
the individual pursues the acquisition of it as the pearl of great price.
But what is Truth?
This question, just as in the day when it was asked, nearly two thousand years ago,
is still, with too many, as carelessly made, and its solution as negligently sought.
"`I have chosen the way of truth;`" that was the Psalmist`'s choice.
"`Your judgments have I laid before me;`" that was
the way by which he was enabled to effect his purpose,
in obtaining the object of his choice.

And thus it must be with us.
The judgment of the Lord in his dealings with us are to be our great lesson;
so that we are enabled decidedly to affirm, "`for such a sin,
I met with such a chastisement;`" and "`for such an endeavour to act rightly,
I was rewarded with so much peace of mind.`"
And, being well disciplined in learning out of our own book,
we may look at the book of the world,
and read everywhere that God`'s judgments enfold in them "`the way of Truth.`"

A wise man`'s heart discerns both time and judgment.
Because for every matter there is a time and judgment.
____

It is highly desirable to hold a tight rein over
that strength and eagerness of will which,
upon the first suggestion of a matter, rushes out at once to the fulfilling of it.
Wait--wait, and always wait, till the immediate heat of impulse has cooled a little.
Wait to feel after that discernment of the right time and way of doing things,
which is quite essential to their success.
All sudden and violent things are short lived, with respect to the good they produce;
but quiet and well considered matters are likely to endure,
because they carry inherent truth in them.
It is said of wisdom, "`I cause those that love me to inherit substance.`"
Wise counsels grow into substantial deeds; but hasty impulses are crude and sour,
and develop only unripe fruit.
"`It has no stalk:
the bud shall yield no meal`" Hosea 8:7. Intense watchfulness alone can obtain,
and preserve, the well matured state of mind, which "`discerns both time and judgment.`"

Woe to the crown of pride, to the drunkards of Ephraim,
whose glorious beauty is a fading flower which is at the head of the verdant valleys,
to those who are overcome with wine!
____

There is a delightful charm in beautiful objects, beautiful music,
and many other things which appeal to the senses; but nevertheless,
in all these attractive things, the elements of true beauty are, for the most part,
so deteriorated by the corruption to which they are united,
that they only deserve to be classed with the abominations that filled
the golden cup of the woman who sits upon the scarlet coloured beast,
Rev.
17:3. Their beauty, and the seemingly beautiful emotions they excite,
are but "`fading flowers.`"
Such emotions, we may observe, are usually found in those who are full of prosperity,
and who know nothing, and care nothing, for the discipline of the cross;
but who have their portion in this life,
and whose dwelling is in the "`verdant valleys`" of luxury and indolence,
and whom this Scripture characterises, as "`the drunkards of Ephraim.`"

A merry heart does good like a medicine; but a broken spirit dries the bones.

There is a dark nature within us, and there is a dark spirit that lodges in,
and works in that nature;
and sad indeed is the hour when these unite to bow down and tempt the poor soul.
Greatly is the danger and evil increased when, in this gloomy state,
the mind comes in contact with the darkness of other minds.
The best preventive, and the only cure of this direful state,
is to be found in the constant cultivation of an innocent, healthy, hopeful spirit.
To this end, avoid whatever excites any bitter, satirical thoughts of others.
"`But they are so disagreeable!`"--says nature.
"`Well, and what are you, yourself, in the evil hour?`"
If things and people are disagreeable,
the gazing upon their defects will not lessen their disagreeableness.
Turn away from all such contemplations, as you would from a person covered with leprosy;
and understand the fulness of that word which says, "`look unto me and be saved.`"
Look unto the meek beauty, the patient love of God`'s blessed Lamb,
and sing for joy that you have such a Redeemer.

He shall choose our inheritance for us.

How differently, often, would the will of the creature ordain the outward lot,
to that which is appointed it by the will of the Creator!
Yet, when the soul is sincerely desirous of not sowing to the flesh, but to the Spirit,
how certain is the destiny of being made just that
which is best fitted for peace and goodness!
For oh, how tender is the Lord of every spark of his own life!
How carefully does he order every circumstance for the growth of the good,
and for the eradication of the evil seed!
Be satisfied then, O doubting, anxious soul, be more than satisfied;
be thankful that God should choose your inheritance for you.
Let faith and patience have their perfect work; and be humble,
and submit to humbling things.
These trials are painful, no doubt; but what a profitable thing is pain!
What a means for manifesting the nature of God`'s grace in the soul! "`Destroy it not,
for a blessing is in it;`" and out of it that word will be fulfilled,
"`I will allure her, and bring her into the wilderness, and speak comfortably unto her.
And I will give her her vineyards from there,
and the valley of Achor for a door of hope.`"
Endeavour firmly to believe, for you surely may,
that "`the valley of Achor`" is often God`'s blessed place of rest,
and the helpless creature`'s sanctuary.

God is love; and he that dwells in love, dwells in God, and God in him.
____

We desire to be happy; let us then love, for love is the end,
and the consummation of all God`'s purpose in calling us into existence.
But let us love with the spiritual love of the true "`Jerusalem,
which is the mother of us all,`" and which comes down from heaven,
"`as a bride prepared for her husband.`"
For there is the true and the false love; the holy love which endures forever,
and the vain, transitory love which fixes for selfish ends, on things and people,
and moves by fits and starts.
This love is figured by that of the false woman, "`whose feet would not stay at home.
At times she was outside, at times in the open square, lurking at every corner.
Lest you should ponder her path of life--her ways are unstable, you do not know them.`"
This is the love which is born of the flesh,
and lives and dies with the life of the flesh.
But the love which is of God, is born of the Spirit;
and though occasionally blossoming in beauty here,
knows its full fruition only in another and a happier realm than this of earth.

and bring no fruit to perfection.
But that on the good ground are they, which in an honest and good heart,
having heard the word, keep it, and bring forth fruit with patience.
____

"`That your fruit should remain.`"
This is the real fructification.
No fruit can proceed from hasty impulses and sudden, eccentric motives of action.
No seed can expand into vitality in the midst of the choking desires
and cares of a heart which is occupied with this world.
It must be emptied and cleansed of these,
and brought into the clearness and simplicity of truth; and then the seed of the kingdom,
finding itself in a congenial soil, opens, and darts out its fibres and takes root,
and grows, and brings forth fruit.
And what it thus brings forth is no empty chaff, but substance which remains.
Only abide in that which separates you from evil,
by pruning away the choking thorns which impede the growth of goodness in your soul;
and with docility and meekness receive the engrafted word,
as the divine husbandman sees fit to impart it.

Remove from me the way of lying; and grant me your law graciously.

It is not merely the direct falsehood which contains the whole, nor yet, perhaps,
the worst, or the most dangerous part of lying; because there the sin is barefaced,
it wears no mask,
and can never palm itself upon the conscience for anything but what it is.

"`The _way_ of lying`" is the subtle enemy that it behooves us very earnestly,
and very constantly to pray to have removed from us.

Who is there, in the slightest degree acquainted with the deceitfulness of his own heart,
but well knows how manifold are the trickeries, the lures, the idle thoughts, desires,
and imaginations,
"`the great swelling words of vanity,`" and the acting and designs which work
in "`those chambers of imagery,`" that are in the depths of his inner world,
and which are continually trying to seduce him into "`the way of lying?`"

There is a peculiarity in the language of the Scriptures which we find in no other writings;
and that is the conciseness and force with which they present to the mind
subjects for the deepest and most comprehensive scope of thought and feeling.
What treaties could be written, to commend Divine wisdom to our love and choice,
like these few graphic words--"`Her ways are ways of pleasantness,
and all her paths are peace?`"

Oh You, who know our helplessness, ignorance, and folly,
be pleased to stir up within us an ardent desire
to seek our happiness in the pursuit of wisdom.
Reveal to us, by Your pure Spirit,
the preciousness of possessing her as our bosom friend,
and blessed guide--and grant that we may watch,
"`as those that watch for the morning,`" to receive and to preserve the thoughts,

Better is the end of a thing, than the beginning thereof, and the patient in spirit,

____

When we have anything to do with children and young persons,
or undisciplined people of any kind,
how wearisome and discouraging it is to observe how soon the pleasure
with which they engage in any new thing is exchanged for dissatisfaction,
when they discover that this novelty has some difficulty in it.
But, instead of lamenting over this common trait of self-hood,
try and extract from it a valuable lesson of personal application;
and watch _in yourself_ against the same thing.
_You_ perhaps weary of new pursuits when they involve difficulty in them.
But as a means of discipline, constrain yourself to go through with what you undertake,
if it be no offence against prudence and propriety so to do.
And if it be a hasty, undigested measure that you have rushed upon,
you will thus punish yourself for your rashness,
and will learn to be more considerate as to what you engage in for the future.

In his self-sufficiency he will be in distress.
____

There are habits of mind quite unobserved and uncared for,
even by sincerely religious persons, which,
without producing actual defilement to the soul,
are nevertheless great hindrances to its "`walking at liberty.`"
An indulgence in profitless reminiscences of bygone times,
and weaving dreams and dramas for the future, are of this kind.
The pleasure which accompanies such visionary excursions of thought seems innocent;
but it is not so: almost all that thus amuses and deeply interests nature,
is of a dangerous kind.
"`But how can I live in solitude without some recreation for my thoughts?`"
"`The good man,`" we are told, "`shall be satisfied from himself.`"
And again, "`the meek shall inherit the earth,
and shall delight themselves in the abundance of peace.`"
The realities of the present moment must be minded, or we are not in the way of peace.
"`All things are yours,`" says St. Paul, and in truth,
all things do become the property of the simple, humble, sincere soul.
God blesses the _little_ which such a soul possesses, and makes it go far,
and feed to the full; but He sends a blight on the self-indulging nature,
and "`in the midst of its self-sufficiency, it is in distress.`"

____
Except you be converted and become as little children,
you shall not enter the kingdom of Heaven.
____

That which destroys peace of mind,
is the restlessness of desire for something unpossessed.
If the soul were centralized in God, all that it requires for happiness would come to it,
without any striving for it.
But, dislodged from its anchorage,
it rushes forth anywhere in search of that which is to be found by retreating _within,_
not _going out._
Unsatisfied desire, which is the root of human wretchedness,
is only fed and strengthened by these vain attempts to grasp at shadows.
Extreme self-love and covetousness,
both of which are the elements of the pride that
demands a share in all things as its right,
are the springs of this unhappy condition.
The only healing for it, is the innocent meekness of the Holy Spirit,
which sweetens the strong bitterness of nature,
and introduces the soul into the little child`'s state of
contentment and carelessness about the things of futurity,
causing it to be:

The light of God`'s Spirit is the Saviour and Redeemer of the soul.
How soft, how sweet, how infinitely delicate are its mild glances!
Be exceedingly careful in observing when, and how it appears;
for it is soon obscured in its arising, by the ignorant, boisterous will of the flesh.
Yet, being tenderly loved and cherished, it comes again and again, and grows in strength,
till it becomes "`as the shadow of a great rock in a weary land;
a tabernacle from the heat, a refuge to the needy in his distress.`"

Always wait for its appearing to your help in times of trouble.
The mere act of waiting has a portion of its nature and life in it,
and almost necessarily leads it into a meek, humble patience, that sanctifies the soul.
Forever keep away from the disorderly workings of the fleshly mind,
which are the beasts of prey that have "`slain`" this Lamb of God,
from the foundation of the world.

No axiom in Euclid is more sure than that "`with the same measure we use,
it shall be measured to us again.`"
If it were only therefore, as a matter of policy,
it would behoove us to deal tenderly and kindly with one another.
But there is more than this in the words before us.
They do not point to well-doing on the ground of self-interest,
though this may be glanced at:
but their chief aim is to recommend that blessedness of mind which does good,
for the love of good, and which in the exercise of its own sweet and heavenly tempers,
brings forth a recompense truly divine, of good measure "`pressed down, shaken together,
and running over into the bosom.`"

How manifestly is this the language of a heart which the grace
of God has rendered in earnest in its search after truth!
And how certain a test does it offer,
whereby we may try the sincerity of our own individual condition before the Lord.
Can I make this supplication of the Psalmist sincerely my own?
Can I really and truly desire of God to search me, and know my heart; to try me,
and know my thoughts?
Can I beseech him with anxious desire, to see if there be any wicked way in me;
any secret bosom sin, and to bring it forth for correction,
that I may be delivered from its baneful influence,
and led into the everlasting way of truth and holiness?
These are important queries to make,
and they must be both made and answered satisfactorily,
before we have any right to use the words,
and to adopt the experiences of the holy Psalmist as if they were spontaneously our own.

The carnal mind is a dark pit where no water is; and while dwelling there,
we are where God cannot come.
For what communion has purity with impurity?
Come out of this unwholesome and truly "`bottomless pit;`" this place where the
soul has "`no standing,`" but sinks continually in the mire of the fleshly life.
Forever come away from that earthly mind, "`which is not subject to the law of God,
neither indeed can be.`"
Come away from the tempers and feelings which plunge
the poor soul into this horrible dungeon.
Some of these are manifest at a glance, as dangerous and evil; but there is a bland,
enervating kind of beauty in others which disguises them with the garb of innocence,
when they are far enough from deserving to wear it.
Distinguish in yourself what it is that strengthens your moral nature,
and be sure that _that_ is the thing which God desires to
keep alive that it should not go down into the pit.

____

It is not one of the smallest evils of self-indulgence,
that it lowers the individual by causing him to depend upon those
who are morally and intellectually his inferiors in understanding,
for a great part of his comfort.
This should not be.
"`Let his hands be sufficient for him,`" was the blessing invoked upon Judah;
and we are told again and again, that "`the righteous shall inherit the earth.`"
Assuredly this means that, among other blessings,
and without which no blessing could satisfy,
they should inherit respect and honour as their proper portion.
But what does that person inherit who is always, like a child, wanting to be amused,
or petted, or comforted?
Nothing but contempt.
That is the reward which self-indulgence is sure to obtain;
since people instinctively despise those who are insufficient to themselves.
Always cultivate a noble disdain of all those low feelings which incline
you to be ever hunting after something to amuse and please you.
Bear to be silent and solitary, and if it be so ordered, suffering and sad;
and learn to bear it _alone._

Let him take hold of my strength, that he may make peace with me.
____

An internal place of peace and repose, is what the soul seeks, but seeks, alas, in vain,
till it is regenerated to a life and nature that is in unity with peace.
"`What have you to do with peace?`"--is the language of the Spirit of peace,
to him who is "`of the earth, earthy.`"
The fierceness, the contrariety, the self-hood of the sensual life,
interpose between the soul and its proper happiness,
which is "`the rest that remains for the people of God.`"
"`Is there then no balm in Gilead,
is there no physician there,`" to reach to this disease of fallen humanity?
Assuredly there is, and thus he speaks: "`let him take hold of my strength.`"
Do you ask, O wounded heart,
"`tossed with tempest and not comforted,`" what this strength is,
and where it is to be found?
Retire into the depths of your own spirit; be still, be patient;
and as you are thus quiet and resigned,
some little measure of strength will arise within you;
to which obediently yielding yourself,
you will find it increase to your peace and consolation.

the spirit who now works in the sons of disobedience,
among whom also we all once conducted ourselves in the lusts of our flesh,
fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind,
and were by nature the children of wrath, just as the others.
____

It is not the things we do, but the spirit in which we do them,
that renders them significant of our real condition in the sight of God.
For the spirit is the will of the creature; and when this is directed towards the earth,
it cannot but fulfill the desires of the flesh, and of the mind that is earthly.
No education can change this spirit.
It is only by the grace of God, which grants it new life,
that the soul which before was dead in trespasses and sins is made alive unto goodness.
Do not, therefore, look to the good deeds you perform,
nor the evil ones you abstain from; but look at what your will loves and unites with;
for those are the things which nourish and keep alive your real nature,

There scarcely lives a human being who is capable of reflection--however
he may be immersed in the cares and occupations of life,
however indisposed to turn aside and contemplate the condition of his soul in
relation to God and to the purpose for which he was born--who does not feel,
on considering such a Scripture as this, that it embodies a divine and everlasting truth,
and secretly wish that he himself were "`the perfect man`" of whom he speaks.

There is something better than ourselves that is near to all of us;
and it is the will of God that we should observe and reverence,
and faithfully obey the impressions which it makes upon us;
seeing that it ever guides us by a holy sense of satisfaction,
to appropriate to ourselves as the right nourishment of our souls,
whatever is calculated to endue them with divine strength.

Make great account, then,
of the conscious approbation with which you assent to the proposition of the text,
and of the secret assurance you feel that the end of the upright man _is_ peace;
for _that_ in you which judges this righteous judgment,
requires obedience to its law and to its testimony;
and is not to be disregarded without producing very painful and very certain chastisement.

There are few subjects on which the minds of religious
persons are so much confused and divided,
as on that of the cross of Christ.
It is as little my purpose as it is my province, to discuss the point;
for I am fully persuaded that by whatever innocent
means the mind is excited to devotional feeling,
it is helped to some degree of goodness,
even though it should be by placing a crucifix before the eyes,
as is the custom of the Papist.
Let us confine ourselves now to the spiritual and practical cross
which the words of the text point out with unmistakable precision;
even that inward cross to the corrupt will, and deceitful lusts,
and self-pleasing of nature, which we are commanded to take up every day of our lives.
"`In all labour there is profit,
but idle chatter leads only to poverty;`" and in
no labour is there so much invaluable profit,
as in the efforts we make to cross and deny our own will;
and in no idle chatter is there so much poverty,
as prating about religious doctrine without practising self-denial.

Oh, that God would speak... and that he would show you the secrets of wisdom.
____

The whole economy of the material universe, so far as we can observe it,
seems to be balanced and governed by the presence of antagonistic forces.
It can scarcely be doubted that the same law of antagonism
prevails in the spiritual and invisible kingdom _within us._
Hence, in moments of extreme trial,
when ignorant and frightened nature is ready to "`run to and fro,
and stagger and be at its wits`' end,`" could we but be still,
and give time to the proper and appointed regulator to act,
it would doubtless be found to do its appointed work,
in administering the particular help which such a condition stood in need of.
God leaves nothing unassisted that requires, and is in a fit state to _be_ assisted;
though the aid he sends may not be of the kind we expect and desire.
To every moment comes the moment`'s strength;

We are so selfish and one-sided by nature,
that our minds are always feeding upon bits and parcels of goodness; and,
especially intent are they in appropriating to themselves some isolated morsel of virtue;
such as charitable or benevolent feelings, good temper, etc.
It is highly desirable to come out of these nooks and corners of self-love;
and to desire and seek for, large, noble, and universal ideas of goodness,
as being the very essence of Divine love and beauty.
There is a striking prayer of Plato`'s, wherein he says, "`Oh Great All!
Grant that I may be beautiful from within: and that all I possess from without,
may be a help to my internal beauty!`"^
footnote:[Quoted from [.book-title]#Chevalier Ramsay,# vol 2 p. 40.]
These desires after the universality of perfection,
are powerful means of enlarging and elevating the soul to love God for _Himself._
And "`how great is his goodness,
how great is his beauty,`" how worthy of all we have to give of adoration!
We become _that_ in spirit which we truly love and unite with;
and grow in assimilation with the nature of the thoughts with which we feed our minds.

There is a tendency in human nature to delight in images, and objects;
a disposition of mind which, however we may attempt to disguise with fine names,
or to exalt with fine natures,
is nothing else than the innate propensity to idolatry which
is the instinctive religion of the natural man.
It seems as if, even in the days of the Apostle,
the inclination to "`know Christ according to the flesh`" which is now so prevalent,
had been manifested in a measure which occasioned him to use the words here quoted.
To know Christ as our Saviour and Redeemer, we must know him as "`the power of God,
and the wisdom of God;`" near to deliver us from the power of sin,
and to make us holy and righteous, in order that we may be made happy.

It is scarcely to be calculated,
the injury which even sincere persons do to their spiritual growth,
by encouraging an idea that they can never be anything
else but wretched sinners to the end of their days.
We are to remember that Christ is exalted to be a Prince and a Saviour from sin:
not a substitution and covering to those who continue in it.

"`You that are full of noise!`"^
footnote:[Isaiah 22:2]--how truly may it be said to every human being!
And to what, and where, would this hungry fire of whirling anguish conduct its victim,
but to misery, perhaps to madness,
if it were not kept in check by some neutralizing force?
God be praised there is such salvation at hand!
The sure time arrives,
when the wild impulses that are forever leaping over the threshold of the mind,
and deluding it with seducing visions of something new, and something exciting,
will be punished;
and then is the moment when experience and wisdom step in for the culprit`'s good.
Be humble, be still as death, "`you whom the merchants of Zidon that pass over the sea,
have replenished.`"
Yes, be still as death under your chastisement; and learn that _this,_ and this alone,
is the way in which to secure yourself for the future from the inroads which this wild
and violent spirit of fallen nature makes upon your peace and capability of goodness.
Has it not often enough, and too often,
filled your inward dwelling with deceitful promises of joy, and urged you to rashness,
and wildness, and violence, when those promises were found to be false?

[quote.scripture, , Ephesians 4:15]
____
But, speaking the truth in love,
may grow up in all things into him who is the head--Christ.
____

Christ and his Spirit are one; and "`if any man have not that Spirit, he is none of his.`"
But no man can say that he is destitute of it;
for a manifestation thereof is given to every man to profit withal.
It is the slighting of the unspeakable gift,
that causes the dearth of that life and power which it is the design and desire of God,
by his grace, to bestow upon all his rational creatures.
"`For the grace of God which brings salvation has appeared to all men; teaching them,
that denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, they should live soberly, righteously,
and godly in this present world.`"
And it is under the power and presence of this Spirit of grace,
which is the Christ of God,
"`in whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge,`"
we are to "`grow up in all things into him;`" and,
leaving our natural condition of self-hood and sin,
are so to cleave to our heavenly Guide, and be so fed and nourished by his divine life,
that as the newborn babe is nurtured by its mother`'s milk,
our souls will also advance in strength and vigour by the Word that dwells in us.

[quote.scripture, , Proverbs 5:3]
____
The lips of an immoral woman drip honey, and her mouth is smoother than oil.
____

There is a most delusive spirit near to man;
a whisperer of words that seem too sweet and lovely to have any danger in them;
but the ways which they lead into are often "`bitter as wormwood,
and sharp as a two-edged sword.`"
Put far from you this inward speaker, with "`deceitful mouth and perverse lips.`"
Be exceedingly simple, and single, and humble internally;
for humility has in it the very water of life;
whereas the character of the immoral woman, the false Spirit of this world,
is invariably proud and inflating.
She "`turns aside the just by empty words;`" and puffs it
out into a charming vision of self-aggrandisement.
_I,_ the attractive _I,_
may always be noticed as the centralizing point to which she makes all homage tend.
Oh, how vile, how utterly loathsome to the true Spirit,
are such workings of the fleshly nature!
How instantly and instinctively does she who ought
to be "`the mother of us all,`" the true Jerusalem,
draw away _her_ child from hearkening to this seducer;
and remind him that "`the immoral woman (the false spirit) that flatters
with her lips,`" dwells "`in a house that inclines unto death,
and her paths unto the dead`" Proverbs 2:18.

[quote.scripture, , 1 Cor 4:20]
____
For the kingdom of God is not in word, but in power.
____

The strength, the ability to rise to the occasion--in a word,
the _power_ which our religious principles invest us with,
is the only just criterion of their truth and value.
For, it is as a Redeemer from iniquity, that the Holy Spirit is bestowed upon us;
and it is only in feeling that we possess this "`power of God unto
salvation,`" that we can possibly have any faith in it.
No description of it will suffice, for words will not impart it.

There must be a sense of illumination experienced in the soul, which,
while it reveals the right path, does also impart the strength to walk in it.
"`Walk in the light, as children of the light,`" is only a mode of saying to us,
with the most lucid simplicity of direction, "`feel the power of Christ`'s Spirit.
Don`'t talk about it; don`'t let your strength evaporate outwardly;
but eye this inward power--be gathered into it--and stand still in it;
and see the salvation of God.`"

=== CCXIV

[quote.scripture, , Hosea 10:1]
____
Israel is an empty vine, he brings forth fruit unto himself.
____

It is a great matter to know and to cherish the fruit-bearing branches of your spirit,
and to separate them from the false blossoms.
For, there are thoughts and feelings which are true and of God;
and to these the Spirit of God unites, and holy fruit is produced by the union,
and this fruit remains.
There are also thoughts and feelings which spring from the empty vine of selfhood,
and to these evil spirits unite, and the fruits of evil deeds ensue.

How important is it, then,
to "`take heed and be quiet,`" and to keep an ever watchful eye
as to what is the nature of the spirit to which we yield our will.
Scarcely anything seems to be safe for us, but the little child`'s state,
which thinks of nothing, and desires nothing,
but remains satisfied and pleased with the present moment,
and with the circumstances of the present moment; and looking neither behind nor before,
dwells in the NOW, the I AM. "`_Dwell_ in the land,
and verily you shall be fed,`" is a Scripture which has a profound meaning,
when taken in the comprehensiveness of its spiritual significance,
and as pointing to that "`land of uprightness`" which David prays to be led into, Psalm 143:10.

=== CCXV

[quote.scripture, , John 6:32-33]
____
But my father gives you the true bread from heaven.
For the bread of God is he which comes down from heaven, and gives life to the world.
____

Desire, or hunger, is the very spirit of life;
and the satisfaction of it the support of all life.
That which feeds and nourishes us, we enjoy;
and a merciful ordination of Providence has annexed this pleasure to the
use of the means that are necessary to the preservation of our existence.
Equally necessary, in a spiritual sense, are the same means to the sustenance of the soul.
It must hunger, and it must be fed, or it has no divine life in it.
Now, what is the proper food of the soul?
Surely that of which the text speaks--"`The bread of God which comes down from heaven,
and gives life unto the world.`"
The Spirit of life, the Spirit of truth:
this is the holy bread on which the soul must feed.
Do you know your food?
Do you love it?
Are the breathings for the Father`'s love, the sweet thoughts that love suggests,
and the tender yearnings of the new nature, felt to be so precious,
that the cry of your soul is "`Lord, evermore give me this bread?`"

=== CCXVI

[quote.scripture, , Isaiah 26:3]
____
You will keep him in perfect peace whose mind is stayed upon you,
because he trusts in you.
____

To have the mind brought into any degree of permanence and stability,
is to be in possession of something very precious, and which is inconceivably rare.
I do not mean to say that it is by any means rare to meet with persons, who,
by the aid of obstinacy and pride,
and the overweening confidence in their own strength which these frailties produce,
are endued with permanence enough, and more than enough,
in abiding by their own will and way.
But there is no security, and no peace in such permanence as this: no staidness,
no deliverance from the yoke of the passions,
and no anchorage for the soul in times of storm and tempest.
This can only be found in the strength of a faith which looks beyond
the fluctuations of time and sense for its resting place;
and which stays itself upon God, even upon Him who never deceives nor disappoints,
but more than meets the humblest efforts that his
helpless creatures make to put their trust in him,
and rewards them with a taste of his "`perfect peace.`"

=== CCXVII

[quote.scripture, , Proverbs 21:5]
____
The plans of the diligent lead surely to plenty, But those of everyone who is hasty,
surely to poverty.
____

Always remember that purposes look amazingly different, _before_ and _after_ their execution.
Consider, therefore, again and again,
before you proceed to acting out any doubtful desire;
for there is nothing in which the craft and subtlety of self-will (probably actuated
by evil spirits a thousandfold more crafty and subtle) so entirely misleads,
confuses, and darkens the soul,
as in those urgent promptings to rush upon hasty words and deeds, of which all persons,
at times, have experience.
Words and deeds moreover, which never can be recalled,
and which in their consequences produce matter for unceasing regret.
"`Their feet run to evil, and they make haste to shed innocent blood.`"
How forcible is this figurative language in portraying the violent, sudden impulses,
which, when yielded to, destroy the meek, pure,
innocent life of God`'s Holy Spirit in the soul!
Oh, pray for light and strength to _be still,_ when these destroyers are at hand!

=== CCXVIII

[quote.scripture, , Jeremiah 48:28]
____
O you that dwell in Moab, leave the cities, and dwell in the rock,
and be like the dove that makes her nest in the sides of the hole`'s mouth.
____

Away from noise and multiplicity,
God`'s Spirit guides the soul to "`be like the dove,`" that seeks concealment,
"`and makes her nest`" afar from the multitude.
Evermore seek to prepare for your soul an abode of peace.
"`The Lord loves the gates of Zion more than all the dwellings of Jacob.`"
The meek, the lowly, the lamblike nature of his Holy Spirit, this is his delight and joy;
here is "`that Zion which he loves.`"
Vain, and worse than vain, in the presence of truth, and truth`'s righteous judgment,
are the workings, and strivings, and exaltations of the intellectual part; for these all,
and always act for self-love and vain-glory.
They cannot be pure, they cannot be humble,
until they have been brought down to the dust, and made to know their natural pollution,
and deeply and constantly to disown and detest it.
Then indeed they may act for God`'s glory, and the soul`'s advantage,
for they will have passed through the furnace of purification.

[quote.scripture, , Jeremiah 17:9-10]
____
The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked; who can know it?
I, the Lord, search the heart, I test the mind,
even to give every man according to his ways, according to the fruit of his doings.
____

Manners and customs change, and change for the better in civilized communities;
but nature remains the same, and with respect to humanity "`deceitful above all things,
and desperately wicked.`"
Nothing can change this, its radical condition; for nothing can change natures.
"`Can the Ethiopian change his skin, or the leopard his spots?
Then may you also do good, who are accustomed to do evil.`"
It is by the predominance of a new and better nature,
that the soul is redeemed from the bondage of corruption,
which is its condition by its first birth.

Do you ask how this predominance of the better nature is to be obtained?
Hear the Scriptures--"`I the Lord search the heart.`"
"`The Spirit of man is the candle of the Lord.`"
That better Spirit than our own, that candle which the Lord has placed in the conscience,
is the light by which we are to "`search and try our ways,`" and turn from all evil,
and from the power of Satan unto God.

[quote.scripture, , Ezekiel 34:16]
____
I will destroy the fat and the strong, I will feed them with judgment.
____

A sort of bold,
triumphant spirit of self-complacency is wonderfully rife in strong-feeling persons;
which, when it is regarded in the light of the Spirit of God, is detected at once,
and properly despised and renounced by the individual in whom it appears.
It is seen to be of the fat and strong, amidst the progeny of the fleshly mind,
which God feeds with judgment and destroys.
Observe then, and keep close to that within,
which judges down all the stirrings of vanity,
and which excites a sentiment of disdain at their enticements.
It is Wisdom "`the Mother of fair love,`"^
footnote:[Ecclesiasticus 24:18]
that "`passes and goes through all things, by reason of her pureness,`"^
footnote:[Wisdom of Solomon 7:24]
that is the judge here; and that "`separates between cattle and cattle;`" loving,
and protecting the weak and helpless,
which are oppressed and grieved by the fat and strong;
and dealing sharply in judgment with those that persecute and tyrannize over them.
This calm, meek, simple thing, which has no communion with that which exalts itself,
and claims to be some great one, _this_ is the interior thing to love, and cherish,
and watch, and wait for, and to _obey._

=== CCXXI

[quote.scripture, , Ephesians 6:13-14]
____
Take up the whole armour of God, that you may be able to withstand in the evil day,
and having done all, to stand.
Stand therefore, having girded your waist with truth.
____

There is an energy in the will which renders it near
to accomplishing whatever it is determined to do.
We have only to be firmly centred in it,
and it will carry us vast lengths towards the fulfilment of our purpose:
and when it is a right purpose, it will carry us through with it,
because then the will of God regulates and is united with it.
It has been proved in many instances that to _stand_ firmly fixed upon a point,
so as to give the immense mysterious power of the will to that point,
will enable the individual to surmount even the pangs
and horrors of the most hideous death.
The case of the North Americans in the endurance of torture from their victors in war,
sufficiently manifests this.
_They_ stand centred upon pride, which never brings any joy with it;
but martyrs to Truth have died sweetly rejoicing, because they were centred upon God.

=== CCXXII

[quote.scripture, , John 8:32]
____
And you shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.
____

From how many now, as in the days when these words first were spoken,
would the answer be,
"`we were never in bondage to any man;`" so unconscious is the
mind of that worst form of slavery in which it is enthralled,
through the dominion of sin and self-hood,
and its ignorance of what makes for its real happiness?
That this is the knowledge of truth,
is manifested by the eager rush after novelty in
the shape of religious teaching and preaching,
which from time to time is noticed rising up.
People want to be happy, and know that truth must be the road to it.
But it is the mistake of mankind to conclude, that whatever lies close at hand,
and within reach of all, cannot be worth taking up.
God, however, has not rendered the acquisition of Truth a remote or difficult achievement.
"`The word is very near you, even in your mouth, and in your heart, that you may do it.`"
And what is the role of this word in the heart,
but to guide us to the knowledge of truth;
and by establishing its dominion in our consciences,
to set us free from the thraldom of error?

=== CCXXIII

[quote.scripture, , Eccles. 7:14]
____
In the day of prosperity be joyful, but in the day of adversity consider:
surely God has appointed the one as well as the other,
so that man can find out nothing that will come after him.
____

A curious circumstance is recorded in the work called [.book-title]#The Englishwoman in Egypt,#
of its being considered so unlucky to congratulate anyone upon his health or prosperity,
that on the author`'s once doing so respecting the healthy state of some children,
the mother exclaimed in consternation, "`bless the prophet!`"--with a voice of alarm,
as if imploring that the boasted blessing might not bring a reverse.
This is superstition; but it has its root in a mysterious but certain truth;
for when we begin to "`count our towers,`" and to think with the Psalmist,
that "`our mountain stands strong,`" it is often the precursor to sad changes of condition.
The lesson then, seems to be,
that we are to possess all our advantages as though we possessed them not; seeing that,
by a necessary law, all inequalities must at some time be rectified: prosperity now,
adversity by and by.

=== CCXXIV

[quote.scripture, , John 4:24]
____
God is a Spirit, and they that worship him, must worship him in spirit and in truth.
____

This is the only true worship; and the end of all creeds, and formulas,
and religious ceremonies, is to bring us to the knowledge of it;
though none of these can teach it; since no creeds can teach the heart to love,
however they may help the head to learn doctrine.
"`If a man would give for love all the wealth of his house,
it would be utterly despised.`"
Love is the freest, the most spontaneous, and the most beautiful of all things.
"`Love is of God;`" and wherever it exists in purity, _there_ is so much of God.
He it is, and he alone, who by his Spirit teaches the soul to love Him.
And the soul thus taught, yearns for communion with its Source and Owner.
Its longings go forth naturally and sweetly (as the desire of the
babe goes forth for its mother`'s caresses and comfortings) in
loving prayers and praises towards its dear heavenly Father.
We may reverently say,
there is a rapturous interchange of love in their divine communion;
a realization of that exquisite word, "`he will rejoice over you with gladness;
he will quiet you with his love; he will rejoice over you with singing.`"^
footnote:[Zephaniah 3:17]

=== CCXXV

[quote.scripture, , Psalm 51:6]
____
Behold you desire truth in the inward parts; and in the hidden part,
you shall make me to know wisdom.
____

The views which are commonly taken of religion,
incline persons to look for it as something that is necessary to their safety,
rather than as the means of renovating and exalting their moral being,
and filling them with happiness.
This is not the way in which it was regarded by the saints of old.
How often does David speak of God as his joy,
his "`exceedingly great joy;`" and of communion with Him,
as that for which his soul was athirst!
Above all, how does he expatiate with delight upon the exaltation of his nature,
through the operation of God`'s Spirit on his soul!
Thus, in the words of the text,
having testified that the Lord requires "`truth in the inward parts,`" he adds,
"`and in the hidden part you shall make me to know wisdom.`"
It is the growth of his being in the divine life
which is the object of his religious views;
not his safety from pains and penalties.
Look at the whole of the Psalm 119,
and see there his judgment of what religion was to do for him.

____
Keep sound wisdom and discretion; so shall they be life unto your soul,
and grace unto your neck.
____

Pride, though its name is ugly,
is not without its proper and appointed purpose in human nature.
It is intended, when sanctified to its right use,
to lift us above the enslaved degradation of the animal nature,
and lead us to aspire after true nobility of soul.
This is only to be obtained by keeping sound wisdom and discretion;
and the way to this lies through exercises of great
watchfulness over our habits of thought,
which we should aim at keeping pure, elevated, and wise.

"`I hate vain thoughts, but Your law do I love.`"
This was the Psalmist`'s rule; and here we see a noble principle laid down.
It is to be feared that the thoughts of the greater part of persons work only,
or chiefly, in wishing and planning to obtain something which they covet.
Now this is a state of mind which forbids the entrance of anything elevated into it.
Wish for nothing except it be to be more and more humble, to be kept in equilibrium,
and to depend wholly upon God; as He who knows what is best for you,
and who will never fail to give you all that is needful for your highest good.

=== CCXXVII

[quote.scripture, , Proverbs 20:24]
____
A man`'s steps are of the Lord; how then can a man understand his own way?
____

John Foster, the well known essayist, says,
"`I have just been reading an author who mentions with very great force of reason,
'`_that no man could in any situation have acted differently from what he did._`'`"
This seems a startling and dangerous doctrine at the first glance;
but it does not appear so when deeply considered; for we may then perceive,
that it ought no more to lead to recklessness,
than a man`'s knowing he must die should lead to indifference
as to what becomes of his property after his decease.
"`My steps are of the Lord;`" shall I then be careless how I behave
towards this Great Being who holds my destiny in his keeping?
Seeing that I cannot make one hair of my head black or white,
I will resign myself wholly unto him.
I will endeavour to fulfill his will as far as it is made known to me;
and draw unceasing consolation by firmly believing that
every incident in my life is only the unfolding to my sight,
of things which in his eyes were long before established.

____
Let every man gather it according to each one`'s need.
____

It is incalculable what we lose from not looking for God in little things.
Well is it said, "`whoever is wise, and will observe these things!`" Psalm 107:43.
What things?
Why, everything that happens to you; but most of all, the wonderful way in which,
while you are obedient, the Lord sends you just what you need.

"`No good thing will he withhold from those that walk uprightly.`"
It is the prodigal, yet greedy mind of the flesh that comes to need:
the mind that is not satisfied to gather things in the small and
humble way in which it pleases the wisdom of God to provide them;
but which is always looking far ahead, and laying up stores for self-indulgence.
For this nature the Lord has no favour; nor anything but chastisement.
"`Gather according to your need.`"
Take your lot in the immediate business of the moment that is before you.
_There_ is your food for that moment.
Take it, as what the order of God at that time assigns for your gathering.

____
And his name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor...
____

Every human being requires to be governed,
and it is only the foolish and ignorant who "`walk
after the flesh,`" who "`despise government.`"
But these presumptuous and self-willed persons soon come to loss; soon, indeed,
do they understand that word, "`if you give your soul the desires that please her,
she will make you a laughing stock to your enemies
that malign you`" Ecclesiasticus 18:31.

But who can govern the soul but he who knows all its workings, its snares, its enemies,
its dangers?
Therefore it is,
that the wisdom and goodness of God develops from a holy seed of his own nature,
a Wise and Wonderful Counsellor,
upon whose shoulder the government of the "`inner man`" is laid.
Ever seek to know, and to obey this Sovereign of your soul, whose work is salvation,
and whose dominion is peace.
What is the dominion of self-will?
What have you ever found it to be?
"`What fruit did you have then in the things of which you are now ashamed?`"
To be governed, to be restrained, to be counselled,
this is the way to be built into a condition of stability and peace.

=== CCXXX

[quote.scripture, , Mark 11:24]
____
Whatsoever things you desire when you pray, believe that you receive them,
and you shall have them.
____

There is a kind of magnetism in the will,
which gives it the power of attracting to itself whatever it strongly desires,
and of uniting with it.
Hence, the profound wisdom of the precept in the text.
Most assuredly, when we desire with our whole hearts a particular grace of the Spirit,
it flows gently in; and as the mind continues constant in its breathings,
it acquires strength and ascendancy, and at length obtains a settled place in the soul.
God is never lacking towards us; it is we who, by indolence and unwatchfulness,
lose His help, by losing the minute and steady gradations in which it is imparted.
It is most instructive to observe, as I have often had in myself occasion to do,
that the soul is drawn to supplicate for the exact thing that is needed _at the moment._
"`That you may give them their food in due season.
What you give them they gather in.`"
How often have I felt myself led to ask for "`_Patience!
Sweet Patience!_`"--and to utter nothing __inwardly__ but these words by the hour together!
Yet, at every utterance, I have seemed to taste something of the blessed thing I needed,
"`the food in due season.`"

____
The work of righteousness shall be peace; and the effect of righteousness,
quietness and assurance forever.
____

This word of strength and comfort was given me just now,
in somewhat of a struggle to retain my spirit fixed, tranquil, and prayerful.
I saw (as I always see) that there must be but _one thing_ before the soul;
and that to be built and grounded upon this one thing,
which is a sense of the presence of God, and a single eye to this sense,
there must be a constant slaying of the old nature, with its many things,
and bewildered contemplation of them.
Yet, how well worth the sacrifice!
How well worth the pain of nature`'s death again, and yet again,
to come into a state of peace and assurance!
While under the dominion of self,
though it be self ever so highly gifted in intellect or accomplishment,
there can be no assurance of being in the right;
for what can self witness to but its own?
And all that is its own is limited and fallible, though it be the very best of its kind.
I can only be _assured_ of truth, by depending upon something better than myself,
and standing fast on that interior something, as on a rock.

[quote.scripture, , Isaiah 59:19]
____
When the enemy shall come in like a flood,
the Spirit of the Lord shall lift up a standard against him.
____

We get but half way on the road to truth, in the possession of faith in God and goodness;
for, we must also have faith in the existence of the prince of evil,
that we may know his snares,
and be prepared to meet them with the right weapons of defence.
But while it is essential that we should be aware of the restless
and malicious enemy who is always at hand to watch for our halting,
and to take advantage of every avenue which our weakness may leave open,
to come in upon us like a flood, we may rest assured that "`greater is he that is in us,
than he that is in the world;`" and that nothing but our own unfaithfulness
can permit the spirit of evil to conquer us.
Great watchfulness, however, is necessary,
both in keeping guard over those bosom sins which open a door for his entrance,
and also in submitting to the power of God`'s Spirit,
and yielding to him the glory of lifting up the standard
that is to destroy the power of the enemy,
when he _has_ come upon us.
Great need is there at such times of the prayer of Hezekiah, "`O Lord, I am oppressed,
undertake for me!`"

Fear not, for I have redeemed you;
I have called you by your name... When you pass through the waters,
I will be with you... when you walk through the fire, you shall not be burned;
neither shall the flame kindle upon you.
____

It is observed by Mr. Cecil,
that "`there is a power of faith which is stronger than the fear of death,
or there never would have been a martyr.`"
This power of faith wrought in the soul by the Holy Spirit,
though it leaves the agencies of evil men, and evil influences free to do their worst,
still so annihilates the effects of their assaults,
that many have triumphed at the stake, and under the instruments of bodily torture,
and thus have indeed "`glorified the Lord in the fire.`"
We are, in these times,
happily exempted from any danger of being called to our
last exigency through exercises of this severity.
Still,
there is something in the fleshly part that quails at the idea of death in any shape;
and hence the preciousness of such promises as this divine Scripture extends even to us.

Through desire a man having separated himself, seeks and intermeddles with all wisdom.

There is a striking quotation in a work I lately met with,
from the Roman Emperor Marcus Antoninus.^
footnote:[Chevalier Ramsey`'s [.book-title]#Philosophical Principles,# vol.
2 page 454.]
It is this:

[quote]
____
You are composed of three parts, body, soul, and spirit.
The two first belong to you only in a certain degree;
the third is what properly belongs to you, it is yourself.
If you, then, separate from this superior part or spirit, whatever others think or say,
if you forget what you yourself have said or done, and all that you foresee, or fear,
all the motions that proceed from the body,
all that is agitated and hurried along by the outward whirlpool of life, then,
your pure intelligence united to eternal order, and delivered from the yoke of passion,
may live from within, forget the past, not think of the future,
and enjoy the present moment in solid peace, strict fellowship,
and perfect union with God.
He that lives thus, concurs with God to the same end, regulates all his wills by His,
and is truly governed and supported by the Divine Spirit.
____

The sum of the whole seems to be,
that before we can "`intermeddle`" advantageously with wisdom,
we must separate ourselves from the influences of the flesh, and fleshly mind.

[quote.scripture, , Psalm 8:2]
____
Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings have you ordained strength because of your enemies,
that you might still the enemy and the avenger.
____

Strong temperaments are exceedingly liable to fierce assaults from the enemy,
on the side of bitter and violent tempers.
When these are allowed any ascendancy,
a thousand flood-gates are lifted up for the rushing in of wicked spirits,
and the poor hunted soul is presently like a whirling wheel of fire.
No reasoning on the folly, or even the sin, of this condition, is of any avail;
for the victim of it knows better than anyone else
what a fearful and dangerous state it is.
It is in the silencing of reason, and of intellect,
and all the workings of the soul that the true remedy for this disorder is to be sought.
It is in "`the meekness of wisdom,`" the innocence of the "`babe and suckling,`"
that God ordains the strength that stills and puts down the avenger.
Only be quiet, and _feel after_ humility, and peace, and silence;
and you will find that _here_ is the true place of refuge in all trials.

[quote.scripture, , Isaiah 56:10-12]
____
His watchmen are blind, they are all ignorant, they are all dumb dogs, they cannot bark,
sleeping, lying down, loving to slumber.
Yes, they are greedy dogs, which can never have enough;
and they are shepherds which cannot understand; they all look to their own way;
every one his gain from his quarter.
Come, say they, I will fetch wine, and we will fill ourselves with strong drink;
and tomorrow shall be as this day, and much more abundant.
____

How vivid a picture have we here of the natural man with his love of ease and pleasure!
How entirely does _he_ look to his own way, and only that!
When does _he_ ever have enough, or cease from the cry of "`Give, give?`"
Yet, to what purpose is it to indulge this strength of fleshly appetite?
It is insatiable and "`grows by what it feeds on.`"

It is the retiring, humble, patient seed of the divine nature, that is to be sought for,
and brought forth from the horrible pit and miry clay, that it may live.
Much, no doubt,
must be passed through of conflict and difficulty in raising it from its grave;
but no price is too great to pay for a sensible experience of its presence and power.

____
My soul is among lions,
and I lie even among them that are set on fire...
God shall send forth his mercy and his truth.
____

What _can_ I do?
This is the agitated query of the fiercely assaulted soul when hunted
by those wild impulses of the will that would "`swallow it up.`"
The only answer is, "`rest (be silent) in the Lord, and wait patiently for him.`"
Do nothing, and, as much as possible, think of nothing, while the storm is raging;
but keep the inward mouth "`as it were with a bridle.`"
What says the Psalmist?
"`Truly my soul waits (is silent) upon God.`"
This silencing of inward words and motions is intensely difficult and painful;
but the pangs it enforces are full of life and healing.
"`Heaviness may endure for a night, but joy comes in the morning.`"

It is only through suffering, and suffering that is patiently endured,
that the dross of evil can be consumed.
After you have suffered awhile,
"`God will send forth his mercy and truth,`" and deliver you from the den of the lions,
and make you all the stronger for the experience
you have acquired in that terrible habitation.

____
The Lord is my light, and my salvation.
____

God`'s way of teaching and guiding the soul, is only to be learned by very quiet,
very long, and very patient observation.
"`My son, give me your heart, and let your eyes _observe_ my ways.`"
This is one rule.
Again; "`whosoever is wise and will _observe_ these things,
even they shall understand the lovingkindness of the Lord.`"
What then are we called to observe?
It is the rapid,
delicate gleams of _light_ which here and there break
forth upon the natural darkness of the heart.
This is strikingly typified in Ezekiel`'s vision (1st chap.):
"`And the living creatures ran and returned as the appearance of a flash of lightning.`"
And again in Zechariah 4:10,
"`These are the eyes of the Lord which run to and fro through the whole earth.`"

Forever, therefore, be reverently tender of the least gleam of the Lord`'s light,
for salvation is in it;
and it is only by observing and obeying the celestial
gleams and glances of eternal truth,
that the soul can be turned away from the darkness of the flesh,
and from the snares of the dark power that works there to its destruction.

____
We have a strong city; salvation will God appoint for walls and bulwarks.
____

The Scriptures of the Old Testament are full of the most powerful imagery; and,
after the manner of Oriental diction,
they present us with vivid representations in symbolic language of our interior world.
This, of a city, in which salvation is appointed of God to be the walls and bulwarks,
strikingly illustrates the condition of the soul when built up by the Spirit of truth,
into wisdom and stability.
"`He that has no rule over his own spirit,
is like a city that is broken down and without walls.`"
And this is the state of all who are destitute of those
walls and bulwarks which constitute the salvation of God.
For, although there may be much power of self-control in concealing thoughts and emotions,
and altogether an appearance of interior strength,
there must always be in the heart whose salvation is not built in the wisdom of God,
some defenceless side through which evil finds an entrance.
The strong city is that only in which the Spirit of God rules.

Will you not from this time cry unto me, My father, you are the guide of my youth?
____

The soul is in a hopeful state when,
touched and melted by a sense of the nature of God as a
Father who is full of compassion and lovingkindness,
it can readily respond with gratitude and joy to these words of Holy Writ.
And who is there, at all within reach of such a tender appeal,
and in the smallest degree sensible of the convictions of conscience,
who in reviewing the times without number in which the Fatherly
goodness of God has interposed to save him when he was bent
upon ways and doings that must have detailed misery,
if not absolute destruction upon himself; who is there, I would ask,
that may not thankfully and contritely say, "`Yes, my Holy One,
forever and forever I will cry unto you, my Father?`"
Oh, seek earnestly,
and pray that it may be given to you deeply to feel the
profound tenderness of this divine appeal to your soul!
And, however oppressed by sin or by the adversary, to remember these blessed words,
"`Will you not cry unto me, my father, you are the guide of my youth?`"

Restore to me the joy of your salvation, and uphold me by your generous Spirit.

I feel as if I could never sufficiently impress upon my mind a
distaste to that ignoble but too common view of religion which
regards it chiefly as a means of security from punishment;
nor, as if I could too often,
or too deeply engage in the refreshing contemplation of it as a source of holy joy,
even that joy which the words of the Psalmist so frequently suggest.
In those before us, how profound,
how touching are the feelings they inspire! "`Restore to me the joy of your salvation!`"
How fervent, how full of tender yearning is the supplication!
How evidently the out-pouring of a soul that had lost its best and dearest treasure!
And thus should it be with us; and thus it could not fail to be,
if we held the same views of the nature of God`'s salvation as David did.
For it was not to be saved from hell, not to know himself secure from punishment,
that was the salvation he prayed for so earnestly;
but to feel the presence and power of the Holy Spirit of God redeeming him from sin,
and making him pure and lovely in the sight of God.

And now brethren, I commend you to God,
and the word of his grace which is able to build you up,
and to give you an inheritance among all them that are sanctified.
____

The wretchedness of the human being in his desolate, ignorant,
and confused condition when left to himself,
occasions him to be perpetually looking abroad for objects of interest and amusement.
His mind possesses nothing, consolidates nothing; and though,
as to outward form and semblance,
he has passed from the state of a child,--yet the child`'s nature
in the desire after amusement remains unaltered in him.
The only thing altered is the character of the toys he clamours for;
he wants them to be of another sort--that is all.
It is to take the human creature out of this pitiable state of poverty and misery,
this shattered, homeless condition of interior desolation,
that God in his mercy has interposed,
and sent to the aid of mankind the "`word of his grace,`" or that portion
of his own light "`which gives light to every man coming into the world.`"
And, as this light is minded, it makes manifest all stumbling blocks,
and takes them out of the way; and builds up the soul into a quiet habitation,
and makes it rich with an inheritance of its own.

My soul follows hard after you; your right hand upholds me.
____

No spiritual exercise is so intense in its nature
as that of retiring inwardly to wait upon God;
but like all acts of labour, it produces a return of profit.
In fact,
it is the only species of devotion that brings the soul
to the knowledge of its actual state before the Lord;
for while waiting, it is in a state of observation,
by means of which acquaintance is made with spiritual and invisible things.
Two very striking circumstances may be briefly alluded to
among the things to be observed in this act of waiting.
The motions of our own mind, and the opposing motions of the Spirit of God; which,
by way of illustration,
we may liken to the two forces that regulate the motions of the heavenly bodies.
First, there is the out-rushing of the will; and secondly,
there is a checking of this vehement forth-darting energy,
by the centralizing power of the Spirit of Truth.
It is in obeying this restraining influence,
that the words of the Psalmist will be well understood,--neither
can they be understood without that obedience.

____

Hard and contrary to the will and wishes of nature,
are the leadings and rebukes of the Spirit of God.
Yet, what love and what mercy are enfolded in their crossness and contrariety
against corruption! "`The Spirit lusts against the flesh;`" its
longings and desires are clean contrary to it,
and while these prevail,
the animal nature is held down and cannot do the things that it would.

What a token of mercy and favour is it,
that the blind yet furious strength of the creature`'s will should
find itself thus crossed and obstructed at every turn!
What salvation for it that it "`_cannot_ do the things that it would!`"
God has hedged up its way, and it _must_ be still.
But _is_ it still and submissive?
Alas, is it not rather too often while in this restricted state,
like a "`wild bull in a net?`"
Does it not toss and tear in its rage,
and by its own folly often draw upon itself the heaviest
of judgments in that awful sentence,
"`Ephraim is joined to his idols; _let him alone!_`"
Oh, forever be obedient to the reproofs _within;_ and say respecting them, "`I was dumb,

How active and insatiable are the workings of the heart after joy!
Now it is this thing, now that, but never the thing that is near, and simple,
and feasible, that is to produce the desired happiness.
Abundant in treasures, and unlimited in covetousness,
dwelling upon many unstable waves of impulse, in vain is every effort after satisfaction.

"`Your rowers have brought you into great waters,`" where you can cast no anchor,
and find no resting-place; and thus uncentred and tossed about,
the end of your vanities find you; and whose shall these things be,
for which you have laboured as it were in the fire?

O, "`take heed and beware of covetousness!`"
Your life consists not in the variety and abundance of your resources,
nor in anything that ministers to the gratification of your senses; but in present peace,
present obedience, present patience;
and in fulfilling simply and humbly the little duty of the present little moment.

This is the true God, and eternal life.
____

How deeply spiritual,
how full of divine unction is this view of our relationship to Christ:
"`We _know_ that the Son of God is come.`"
Here is no future, no doubt, no remote hope of some acquaintance with him; he is come,
and we know it.
Do you ask _where_ is he come, and how he manifests his presence?
This is the answer: "`God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness,
has shined in our hearts,
to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.`"
It is to the heart of the believer that the Son of God comes;
and there he makes himself known as the source of divine light and truth;
so that the soul is in no doubt as to where it is to abide, or what it is to do;
but under the power which this holy Guide imparts, it acts or it is still,
it suffers or it enjoys, and makes its dwelling in the bosom of its Beloved;
satisfied to _know_ (not to have a notion only) that "`it is in him that
is true;`" and able to say from the depth of its divine joy and satisfaction,
"`this is the true God and eternal life!`"

and point with living light to the course it must pursue to be at peace.
O troubled soul,
stoop down beneath the billows and the "`noise of

"`where the flocks lie down at noon.`"

Try and stay yourself on inward silence till this tyranny of nature has passed.
It will subside; believe me, it _will_ subside.
Only behave, and quiet yourself with a humble look to the Father for blessed stillness,
blessed patience, that your weaning time may go on without hindrance; and you,
cleansed and delivered from all your idols, and all your iniquities,
may stand before the Lord well prepared to receive the new heart and the
new spirit which he has promised to those who are thus purified,
and made fit to receive it.

And the idols he shall utterly abolish.

It is something more, and something deeper,
than the outward act of idolatry to which these words of the prophet point.
The idols of the heart, the vain thoughts, the monstrous, wild imaginations,
and all those disorderly workings of the natural mind for self-pleasing,
and for self-glorification, which are at the root of all iniquity,
and the means by which the adversary of our souls gains entrance upon
us--these are the idols which the hand of the Lord "`will utterly abolish.`"
It behooves us, then, to have as few of these false gods as possible,
and to turn away from every delusive appearance which presents itself to our senses,
till the light which makes things manifest in their true colours,
reveals to us its nature.
This it will never fail to do, if we are but faithful and patient in waiting upon it,
and obedient in renouncing whatever it shows us to be evil.

Sooner or later, every false thing will have to be taken from us; far easier, then,
as well as wiser, shall we have made our course,
by doing our best to abolish the idols which the Lord is determined to remove.

Nothing advances the soul in the knowledge of Truth, and effectually builds it up,
but the act of waiting upon the Lord;
for this is the most real and the most profitable of all religious exercises.
Never think that nothing is done by this process.
The work of the moment is done, and that is all that can be done,
or that needs to be done, and this only is the way in which it can be done.
If every vain imagination is to be cast down,
and every high thing that exalts itself against the knowledge of God,
and every stronghold of pride and vanity brought into captivity
and made obedient to the Redeemer`'s voice,
must there not be an earnest, silent,
attentive watching as to what is passing within the soul?
And if we would be fed by the Spirit of God,
and know the living bread of Truth handed to us,
"`in due season,`" must not the eye be fixed in order to gather it as it is given?
"`Blessed is the man that hears me, watching daily at my gates,

How intense and undying is the spirit of self-love and self-worship!
And how insensible are we to the strength and subtlety of its workings.
How the mind runs riot with phantasms of personal merit,
and feeds upon the tributes which it either has,
or which it conceives that it ought to have rendered to it for its high deserts!
Ah, if we knew truth, and saw ourselves by its light,
how entirely should we renounce as vile and loathsome
all these "`daubings with untempered mortar.`"
How ashamed should we be, as a beggar is ashamed of his rags,

For the promise is, that "`the meek will he guide in judgment,
and the meek will he teach his way.`"
And never can we be taught God`'s way, till we are meek and still,

There is profound meaning in the words of Genesis 19:22. "`Hurry, escape there (to Zoar,

In this most dangerous and evil state, be still and motionless as death.
"`Go not forth by the field, nor walk by the way,

I am quite aware of the tautology of which I am guilty,
in the endless repetitions I make respecting the duty of waiting upon God.
But it is one which (as it seems to me) is apt to be sadly neglected, and that,
more from ignorance as to what it offers of benefit and blessings,
than from anything else.
The presence of God is what the soul stands in need of for its religion.
In order to obtain a sense of this presence,
we must come daily to that state of spirit which prepares for a perception of it;
and vain, not to say absurd,
is the notion that there is any possibility of making
this preparation but by interior silence.
What is the language of the prophet?
"`Prepare the way of the Lord.`"
And how?
"`Make straight in the desert (of the heart) a highway for our God.`"^

I would ask him to consider what he can make of it in a literal sense!]

Desire always accomplishes its purpose, if it be within the reach of possibilities.
Only let there be the vitality of the will present, and the work is done.
If this seems to be contradicted by facts,
I entreat the doubter of it to pause and consider, and I believe he will find that,
supposing the prosecution of the case to be feasible,
nothing either can or will prevent its fulfilment,
but either its giving place to a stronger desire,
or its losing its original hold upon the mind.
A man, for instance, desires ardently to succeed in business, and to acquire wealth;
but perhaps a stronger desire for the pleasures of sense arises in him,
and the weaker succumbs to it and he fails of his end.
Still, it is desire, though an unworthy one, that succeeds.
And thus it is with spiritual things.
It is desire only that makes them to possess life and power.
God causes the longing soul to find what it seeks, be it good, or be it evil;
and to be satisfied with goodness, there must first be a hunger for it.

as every day of our lives we shall have occasion to perceive,
the powerlessness of the mind to hold communion with God.
It is necessary that we should be deeply sensible of this impotence on our part,
that we may drop all striving, all working of the will and thoughts, and,
as much as possible, sink into nothingness whenever we enter upon devotional duty.
It is only as the mind is cleansed and emptied of itself,
and loosed from the bonds and cords of its iniquities,
that there is room made in it for the entrance of
another and a higher nature than its own.
It is the greatest of all mistakes to imagine that anything of
your own can act in producing what is better than yourself.

and to hold the footsteps of the mind from slipping back to vain and chaffy thoughts.

So overwhelming, indeed, are sometimes the incursions of these robbers and spoilers,
that the poor hunted soul is ready to throw up its engagement in despair.
But this must not be.
Have patience, and again have patience, and come once more to the beginning.
After a strong and courageous conflict with every intrusive thought,
some fixedness will be perceived; and as this strengthens,

It is of vast importance to watch long and closely the nature

The true food is wonderfully small and delicate,

as God gives it,--which is from moment to moment.
Fallen nature devours, it feeds without fear of consequences,
and swallows the portions of today and tomorrow at once.
"`They are all hot as an oven, and have devoured their judges`" (Hosea 7:7);
which mystical language I read to signify that the
tender seed of God which ought to feed,
and judge, and nourish the soul, is devoured by the rampant, animal will of the flesh.
Only watch and wait,
and you will gradually learn to perceive how the right food comes to you,
and at the right time.
"`The eyes of all (all the good) wait upon You, O Lord,

=== Gird up the loins of your mind, be sober, and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ. 1 Peter 1:13

In few things are greater mistakes made,
and with more damage to the growth of the soul in truth,
than in the views which are taken respecting the coming of Christ.
Almost always, this is contemplated as a distant thing, belonging to the Millennium,
and altogether as a matter with which at present, we are not directly concerned.
But the coming of Christ pointed at by the writers of the New Testament,
as in the passage before us for instance, is immediate.
"`Gird up the loins of your mind and hope to the end,`" or, as in the margin,
"`perfectly;`" as if the Apostle had said,
retire inwardly and deeply from the surface-going, loose,
ungirded condition of your fleshly mind; and be quietly,
soberly receptive of the grace that is in God`'s good time
to be brought to you perhaps in the stream of sweet thoughts,
the gleams of pure wisdom, or, it may be, in the mere patient exercise of silence,
that will attend this act of duty.
It is not for you to say in what mode the revelation
of your Saviour`'s presence will be made.
Suffice it that you put yourself in a position of mind to receive it.

=== The Spirit of the Lord shall rest upon him... and shall make him of quick understanding in the fear of the Lord; and he shall not judge after the sight of his eyes, neither reprove after the hearing of his ears. Isaiah 11:2, 3

Constantly feel after something in your spirit that judges righteous judgment,
and that is purer, and quicker than the judgment of reason.
There is such a thing near you, and near to everyone;
but it is a small and despised thing;
a stone which almost all the builders of religion refuse.
Evermore however, it is the chief cornerstone in God`'s holy building in the soul of man.
Come to it daily.
Love its meekness, understand the value of its lowliness, and be gathered into its root,
and "`grow up into it in all things.`"

This blessed thing _is_ salvation; and while united to it, you must be saved;
for while in unity with it, you must be a partaker of its nature of purity and Truth,
and share in all the excellencies so graphically touched upon as its characteristics,
in this word of the Prophet now before us.

=== Babylon was a golden cup in the Lord`'s hand, that made all the earth drunk. The nations drank her wine; therefore the nations are deranged. Jeremiah 51:7

The spirit and the flesh are strikingly exemplified in Scripture,
by the symbolic language of Jerusalem and Babylon;
and need I ask if you know not too well what this description of the Prophet points at?
Does not this wild Babylonish spirit make itself felt in you every day?
Does it not live and move in a hunger and thirst for something, no matter what,
that may produce excitement,
and deliver you for a time from the burden of your own being?
Does it not continually stir up wishes for change,
though you may have nothing to get out of any change but loss?
Oh, that this hunger of the soul were but seen and understood for what it is.
Then, would it be devoutly turned from,
and resisted as that madness of which the Prophet here speaks.
That which is true, and _of_ the truth is always still, and meek, and contented;
and that which is of the flesh is never still, but always restless,
and always discontented.

=== The Lord is my strength and my shield; my heart trusted in him and I am helped; therefore my heart greatly rejoices; and with my song will I praise him. Psalm 28:7

The soul that knows nothing of an inward warfare between flesh and spirit,
can but imperfectly understand the Psalms of David;
which may be shortly described as the related experience of one
who had passed through every state of internal distress and conflict,
and in every exigency, "`looking unto God most High,
unto God who performed all things for him,`" was brought through his trials victorious.

It is remarkable how often this figurative view of God as the shield of the soul,
presents itself to the mind of the Psalmist.
Doubtless he felt that none other so appropriately portrayed the protecting power
which the presence of an Almighty Spirit dispenses to the helpless creature.
Happy is he who shares with David in this soul-sustaining
conception of divine shelter and defence!

=== The Lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall feed them. Rev. 7:17

Nothing but the nature of God can effectually feed the soul,
for nothing else can satisfy it.

Hence the command to "`desire the sincere milk of the word;`" or in other words,
the living food wherewith "`the Lamb that is in the
midst of the throne shall feed`" his sincere followers.
In vain are you looking to other supplies to satisfy the
restless and needy condition in which you find yourself.
Nothing earthly _can_ satisfy that which is immortal.
"`Commit your way unto the Lord.`"
He alone can administer to your relief and rest; and of this be assured,
and for it be prepared,
that he will only help you through the death of all
that clamour of your natural will and desires,
which is perpetually haunting you with suggestions to run out after
some object which deludes you with a promise of pleasure.
Only ask Him to help you to bear the death of self and flesh,
through which you _must_ pass to the marriage supper of the Lamb;
that pure feast of which the master will say, "`eat, O friends,--drink,
yes drink abundantly, O beloved!`"

=== How precious are your thoughts unto me, O God! How great is the sum of them! Psalm 139:17

This is the right testimony on the part of the creature,
to the blessedness of communion with the Creator.
"`How precious are your thoughts unto me, O God!`"
How sweet is that nearness of access, which,
though deeply reverent (for nothing is so lowly as love) yet permits, no,
encourages the out-pouring of the soul in expressions
of tenderness towards its heavenly Father!
Oh, how beautiful, how refreshing, how entirely satisfying,
is this deep interior fellowship!
What a stream of lovely emotions water the spirit at such seasons,
and occasion it to say with the Psalmist, "`whom have I in heaven but you,
and there is none upon earth I desire in comparison with you!`"
This is the "`tasting that the Lord is gracious;`" this
is the feeling that "`he feeds his flock like a shepherd,
and carries the helpless ones, like lambs in his arms,
and lays them to rest in his bosom.`"

=== We wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places. Ephesians 6:12

Very sore and very frequent,
are the assaults of the rulers of the darkness of this world
against the soul that is escaping from their dominion.
They have no need to trouble those who are securely fixed under their sway; and in fact,
they seldom or never do trouble them.
But once you are in earnest in trying to keep your heart with all diligence,
once you set your face as a flint to "`turn away from evil
and do good,`" once you say sincerely with the Psalmist,
"`I hate vain thoughts,`" you will find these principalities and powers,
and rulers of darkness,
coming in upon you at every avenue that your fleshly nature leaves open to their approach.
Be it so.
You need not flinch.
They may, and they _will_ assault;
but it remains with you to render their assaults powerless.
You wrestle not with carnal weapons, but with those which are mighty, through God,
who will not only put them into your hands, but instruct you how to use them.

=== I will make waste mountains and hills, and dry up all their herbs; and I will make the rivers islands, and I will dry up the pools. And I will bring the blind by a way that they knew not; I will lead them in paths that they have not known; I will make darkness light before them, and crooked things straight. These things will I do unto them, and not forsake them. Isaiah 42:15-16

The way of God with the soul that he intends to purify,
and render fit for its master`'s use, is a terrible way to flesh and blood.
But it is a right way; a way that is full of salvation and joy;
and the part of true wisdom is that of implicit obedience to it.
It is through these overturnings of all that the natural heart loves and cleaves to,
that "`wisdom and knowledge become the stability of our times,
and strength of salvation`" Isaiah 33:6.

All our own views of things are mixed with the defilement of our earthly wills and wishes.
It is only in yielding ourselves wholly unto God,
that we understand the word which says "`in your light shall we see light.`"

=== Vain man would be wise, though man be born like a wild ass`'s colt. Job 11:12

How strikingly is our ignorance manifested by our unwillingness
to rest contented with things as they are,
and by the continual starting forth of the mind after change of condition and circumstances.
We cannot even "`_let well enough alone;_`" but unless
restrained at every corner by the hand of God,
are making haste after novelty,
even when there is a secret consciousness in the mind that novelty, when found,
can only bring comparisons with the lot we have despised and renounced,
which would probably afford us ground for repentance.

The state which the providence of God assigns us,
may always be known as the one in which it is our duty to remain,
when there is no opening made for our quitting it without some dereliction of duty,
or some violation of order and propriety.
When we are required to make any alteration in our circumstances,
it is generally indicated by the opening of our way
to such movements as seem to be desirable.

=== Be renewed in the spirit of your mind. Ephesians 4:23

John Foster says it is a "`most interesting idea that of renovated being!
I am not the person I was.
The past is nothing to me; the past I,
is not the present I. I have transited into another person.`"
There is much to reflect on profitably in this remark;
for it is good to come daily into a "`newness of life,`" and to "`put
off the old man which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts.`"

Let us observe the directness and simplicity of this command, "`_put off;_`" that is,
to be done with it, and cast away every reminiscence of this old nature.
Let the past be nothing to you.
And "`_put on_`" the new man; the fresh, wholesome, healthy life of truth;
and thus "`be renewed in the spirit of your mind.`"

Ah, what a divine process is this!
What medicine for all diseases!
Truly, indeed, is it "`life to them that find it, and health to all their flesh.`"

Come to these living springs, and bathe deeply in their invigorating waters;
and feel the power of the Spirit "`making all things new, and all things of God.`"

=== CCLXXII

=== He that gathered much had nothing over, and he that gathered little had no lack; they gathered every man according to his eating. And Moses said, let no man leave of it till morning. Exodus 16:18, 19

Attend diligently to the beautiful equality of all God`'s ways of influencing the soul,
and the exactness with which the supplies of light are fitted to the need.
You will then perceive that it is granted for the immediate occasion, and _for no other._
In vain would you be looking ahead to tomorrow,
and laying up maxims for tomorrow`'s guidance.
Nothing comes of it but corruption.
Keep watch to the moment that is before you.
That is God`'s moment, his _now;_ and you will never find him out of the immediate now.
I AM,--that is his name, and that is his nature.
There is amazing power in thus concentrating the attention on the present moment;
and profound is the scriptural counsel which points
at it in that passage of Proverbs 4:25-27,
"`Let your eyes look right on, and let your eyelids look straight before you.
Ponder the path of your feet, and let all your ways be established.
Turn not to the right hand nor to the left; remove your foot from evil.`"

=== When the poor and needy seek water, and there is none, and their tongue fails for thirst, I the Lord will hear them, I the God of Israel will not forsake them. I will open rivers in high places, and fountains in the midst of the valleys; I will make the wilderness a pool of water, and the dry land springs of water. Isaiah 41:17-18

There is a sense of desolation in being thrown entirely inward upon our own minds,
which is quite overpowering to nature, and which no doubt is designed to be so.

It is necessary that we should be stripped of everything that is pleasing to the flesh,
and brought into the wilderness.
We are then in the condition of "`the poor and needy`" to whom God`'s favour is extended.
All that seems needful to us is patience, blessed patience!
But, unquestionably, there is in this solitary and famishing state,
a terror and failing of heart that is little less than appalling;
and which understands the saying of some old divine,
that "`the way to heaven is by hell;`" and great need have we at such times to
take firm hold of such a comforting Scripture as this before us.

=== The archers have sorely grieved him, and shot at him, and hated him. But his bow abode in strength, and the arms of his hands were made strong by the hands of the mighty God of Jacob. Genesis 49:23, 24

It is of the utmost importance never to give way to the tendency to despair,
or to recklessness,
which is almost certain to appear after there has been any yielding to temptation.
Be as much as possible on your guard against sin; but if overtaken by it,
let no confused and restless efforts to get from under the painful convictions it occasions,
induce you to throw the whole matter up, as impossible to be borne:
a condition of mind which, in very sensitive persons may lead to awful conclusions,
and in those of a more obtuse temperament, to very careless and unholy ones.

We are all frail, all liable to fall.
God, who knows our weakness,
and the cruelty of those evil spirits who make use
of the occasion of our frailty to grieve us,
and shoot their arrows at us, is merciful, upon our repentance, "`to forgive us our sins,
and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.`"

=== He shall not cry, nor lift up, nor cause his voice to be heard in the street. Isaiah 42:2

Watch vigilantly against all sudden, vehement, impulsive feelings;
but yield yourself undoubtingly to such as are tranquilizing, pure,
and of a restraining character.
What you _feel_ is reality to you; and what you do _not_ feel, is fiction.
Feel, then, that which is small, calm, and gentle, opposing--not with words,
but by the firm, silent, _standing_ of truth--all violence, all rapid,
eccentric motions of the will.
Know the ruler who "`does not lift up,
or cause his voice to be heard,`" but who "`gently
leads`" his followers into the right way.
Observe the difference between this Spirit and the false spirit;
observe how that does lift up, how it intoxicates, how it confuses,
how it _shears_ the soul of its strength when once
it has laid itself down on the lap of any Delilah.
O, keep to the little, the lowly, the pure;
keep to that which will not mix or unite with anything
but that which is of its own nature;
keep to this, and you are near your helper, and are prepared for anything,
and everything that may befall you.

=== Through the tender mercy of our God, whereby the dayspring from on high has visited us. Luke 1:78

The Scriptures are blessed helps in revealing to us what we stand in need of for goodness,
and for peace.
In this before us, there are two heavenly truths exhibited for us to consider.
First, the tender mercy of our God, not mercy alone--but _tender_ mercy.
My Creator feels tenderly for me.
Secondly, the way in which this mercy shows itself; as "`a dayspring from on high.`"
What is this dayspring, and where am I to look for it?

"`In Him was life, and the life was the light of men.`"
// lint-disable scan-errors "ray"
This dayspring, therefore, is a light, a direct ray from the life of God,
and no other than the light that shines in my conscience.
Its object is one of tender mercy, even to save from sin which ever brings suffering.
Its visitation is that of love,
to guide me out of the darkness of the flesh and its shadow of death,
unto the way of peace, the way of penitence, the way of holiness, and of eternal life.
"`Great peace have they which love this blessed light,
and nothing shall offend them`" Psalm 119:165.

=== Which indeed is the least of all seeds... Matthew 13:32

Never can you too earnestly, or too frequently,
remember that God`'s ways are just the opposite to man`'s ways.
Man is for carrying his point by force,
and conceives that might and power are the proper agents for accomplishing his will.
God acts by means of gradation; and with a slowness and littleness of advancing, which,
to the boisterous vehemence of the fleshly mind, seems often to be contemptible.
But this is what the Apostle calls "`the foolishness of God, which is stronger than man.`"

You cannot do better than seek diligently after a feeling sense of this holy littleness,
this divine simplicity; which is, "`indeed, the least of all seeds,`" but which,
in its very meekness, carries in it the strength of God,
the Almighty power of that everlasting Truth, which, in the end,
causes "`the little one to have the strength of a thousand,
and the small one to become a mighty nation.`"

=== And he showed me a pure river of water of life, clear as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God, and of the Lamb. Rev. 22:1

There is a sense of divine truth typified in this language which,
as matter of experience, is the same in kind, but various in degree,
in the soul of every sincere believer.
It is a consciousness of something _within_ that is pure, clear, refreshing; and which,
like a stream of water, cleanses away defilement,
and renews with strength the spiritual life.
To come to the enjoyment of this internal consciousness of the divine presence,
is the end of all religious exercises.
"`I will cause those who love me to inherit substance;`" and this
interior sense of holy communion unknown to the world,
and which is a joy "`that no man takes away from
us,`" is a possession most real and substantial;
a portion, and foretaste of the hope laid up for us in heaven,
and a present inheritance "`incorruptible, undefiled, and that fades not away.`"

=== Withhold your foot from being unshod, and your throat from thirst; but you said, There is no hope; no; for I have loved strangers, and after them will I go. Jeremiah 2:25

What a profound truth is wrapt up in this mystical language!
How close a figure is it of the willful nature of the vain mind;
that mind which is always in transgression, always breaking bounds,
and "`hunting _before_ the Lord;`" never waiting to know, and to follow his leadings.
How strikingly does that verse in Job exemplify this state!
"`They are of those that rebel against the light;
they know not the ways thereof, nor abide in the paths thereof.`"
O my soul, abide, abide in the Truth.
But what is Truth?
That which _is._
And what _is?_
The present little moment, and nothing else.
Live then, in this little moment which _is;_
and for which God ever sends the right provision:
and be not wearied in the greatness and falseness of your own way.

=== You are more glorious and excellent than the mountains of prey. Psalm 76:4

How sweet is the _sense_ of God, in the feeling of purity, peace, and love,
which sometimes steals upon the soul with the gentleness of falling dew!
Then it is that this word of the Psalmist`'s opens up in
the full comprehensiveness of its spiritual meaning.
"`Yes,`" the softened and sanctified spirit of the creature exclaims,
"`you _are_ more glorious and excellent than the mountains of prey;
those mighty and aspiring passions of the flesh, those hungry,
rampant energies which are ever seeking their prey.`"
"`In Judah God is known; In Salem also is his tabernacle;
there he broke the arrows of the bow`" Psalm 76:1, 2, 3.

In the still, meek purity of his own Spirit,
he overcomes for the humble and obedient soul what no strength of its own can conquer.
Here then, repair; even to Salem, the tabernacle of peace within you.
There, it pleases the Lord of peace to dwell.
"`My soul, wait silently for God alone, for my expectation is from him.`"

=== But God forbid that I should boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world. Galatians 6:14

Dwell on the spiritual meaning of these remarkable words; and try to experience deeply,
and inwardly, their life-giving power.
Know the cross which crucifies the will and the wishes which are one with the world.
Feel it in that which limits and opposes the wild and wandering nature of self.
Watch in all things for the presence of this cross to inclination;
for life and salvation are in its reproofs and checks,
just as death to all goodness and truth are in the wide gate and broad path of self-indulgence.
O, it is precious to feel the _contrariety_ of the cross of Christ;
to be bounded by it at every turn; to be called back at every wandering; to be gathered,
and girded, and strengthened, instead of running to waste,
and evaporating in dreams and emptiness, consolidating nothing, building nothing,
but working a work of errors, and lying down in confusion and grief!

=== Man does not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God. Deut. 8:3

What is it that affords me a distinct sense and feeling that my
soul is actually fed and nourished with some real goodness?
Is it not my being conscious of some true faith, some true yearning after God,
and obedience to his holy will?
Is it not from my being convinced that it is a blessed will?
Is it not by my hungering and thirsting after that
righteousness whereby I may become upright,
patient, pure, meek, and, in all things, such as God may love and accept?
Surely it is.
And while these holy desires are living and stirring in you whoever you are,
you will find that the Lord will make you to know that Word
of His which is the living bread that comes down from heaven,
and keeps your soul in life.
He will "`open unto you His good treasure,`" and you will be filled with blessings.
Then will you know the "`feast of fat things full of marrow;`" of "`wines on the lees,
well refined;`" the "`cleaned provender which has been winnowed with the shovel,
and with the fan,`" and you will "`delight yourself in the Lord,`" and know what

=== You who seek God, your hearts shall live. Psalm 69:32

There is a heart which is dead in trespasses and sins,
and which can never be in any other state than death towards God,
who is the Fountain of Truth; because "`it is not subject to the law of God,
neither indeed can be.`"

But we are not left to the dominion of this fleshly and sinful heart;
at least it is our own fault if we be.
For God has given to every man a manifestation of his own Spirit to profit withal;
and the first work of this holy Teacher is to draw the soul
to this interior manifestation of light as the source,
and only means of its redemption from sin and misery.

It feels itself bowed down and imprisoned by an evil heart of unbelief, which,
like a corpse bound to a living man, impedes, troubles, and disgusts him.
Thus oppressed, he seeks of him who alone can give it,
deliverance from the bondage of corruption; and then finds the promise true,
that the heart does live that seeks God.

=== He is the living God, and steadfast forever. Daniel 6:26

The unchangeableness of God is the rock upon which the wise man builds his house.
And oh, how safe and secure is it to dwell within the habitation thus firmly established!
For, what is the condition of the human being without a knowledge of the nature of God,
as being "`steadfast forever?`"
Let him be as richly endowed as he may, with health, wealth, talents,
or power of any kind, it is a condition of insecurity.
Everything that does not rest upon the permanence of God, must be insecure.
The laws that regulate the universe rest there; but on what,
or where does the soul of man rest?
Other things are stable and constant; but what is man?
All things are better off than he is,
except in so far as he is delivered from depending upon his own wild, eccentric will,
and the fluctuations of his passions, and becomes acquainted with, and subject to,
the steadfastness of God.
Seek then, before all other seeking,
close unity with the divine and immutable will of God;
for it is the centralizing force which alone can keep you moving in the orbit of Truth.

=== Is not this the fast that I have chosen: to loose the bonds of wickedness, to undo the heavy burdens, to let the oppressed go free, and that you break every yoke? Isaiah 58:6

All that proceeds merely from self-will, is defiled and profitless.
Its religious services, equally with its worldly pleasures, are worth nothing;
because there is no reality, no subjugation of heart,
and nothing in them but a mere getting over, and getting rid of an irksome task.
It is the whole being and nature of the carnal mind that is to be denied and offered up.
"`Is not this the fast that I have chosen?`"--says the Lord.
Is it not "`to loose the bonds of wickedness,`" "`to take away the yoke from your midst,
the pointing of the finger, and speaking wickedness?`"
Yes, this is to be the exercise of your soul.

and let the oppressed seed of God in you go free;

Shall they not rise up suddenly that shall bite you, and awake that shall vex you? Habakkuk 2:5, 7

How forcibly is the inordinate and ravening covetousness
of the fallen nature of man set forth in these words!
The pride of the soul, as one intoxicated with wine--how vivid and true the description!
Surely, in these times in which we live,
we see this wide spreading ambition clearly enough manifested,
and clearly enough in many striking instances, meeting with the reward it merits,
in the "`rising up suddenly,`" of the regrets, the humiliations, and the disappointments,
that bite and vex it.

To "`keep at home,`" to be concentrated within,
to be ever watching and keeping guard over that loftiness
of heart which enlarges its desire as hell,
and is as death, and cannot be satisfied,
but which is ever making matter for sorrow and for repentance,
this is the part of wisdom.

We lose much in reading the Scriptures,

Now this of "`order my steps in your word;`" what
a mine of wealth it contains in the way of wisdom!
Let a savour and sense of the supplication be ever present with you.
Have a regard to your doings as steps; as those continuous and small acts,
by which your progress and growth in goodness is to be advanced.
Let an eye to the presence of God be yours, as you go along in your appointed path;
and be careful not to deviate from his regular and orderly guidance.
How soon is this the case when there is any looking away from the rule, the word of Truth!
O Truth, how saving and precious are you, in your smallness and humility!
And, O self, how dangerous and destructive are you, in your greatness and pride!
With you there are no steps; nothing but strides, and leaps,
and wasteful and irregular movements.
Evermore then, know that which orders your steps, and makes, and keeps them,
the minute and momentary movements which fix you in the everlasting I AM.

=== To be carnally minded is death; but to be spiritually minded is life and peace. Romans 8:6

The world is rich in a variety of pleasures, and in an undiminishing fund of amusements,
toys, games, sports, and contrivances to cheat care, and beguile the time;
and multitudes of both young and old persons go through this Vanity Fair,
as foolish in heart,
and looking about for their trinkets with as much interest and eagerness,
as if they were sent into life for no other purpose than to be entertained.
They procure their toy, and are just as far from satisfaction as ever;
and can never be otherwise than far from it,
while they are under the dominion of the carnal mind;
that being a mind which has nothing to do with peace.

Peace, and rest, and satisfaction, belong to the mind which is born of the Spirit of God.
The whole work of the wise soul is, therefore,
to drop the fleshly mind as an old garment; to come away from its delusions;
to disdain its empty pleasures; to pierce through the veil,
and rise from the contemplation of the things that are seen and which are temporal,
to those that are not seen, and which are eternal.

=== Though I walk in the midst of trouble, you will revive me; you shall stretch forth your hand against the wrath of my enemies, and your right hand shall save me. Psalm 138:7

There are sharp exercises to be borne, and severe anguish to be experienced,
in the breaking down of the stiff and stubborn nature of self.
Among these, the most trying, and the most exceedingly painful,
in fact almost overwhelming, are the vague, but strong feelings of fear and amazement,
and apprehension of evil, which accompany the thought and prospect of death.

We then assuredly "`walk in the midst of trouble.`"
But the resolution of the Psalmist must be ours also, "`Whenever I am afraid,
I will trust in you.`"
This is all we have to look to in every kind of suffering.
And great is the benefit, most complete the cleansing, which a patient, quiet,
sustained trust in God at such times brings with it.
Assured may we be, that sharp and prolonged as our trials may be,
they will nevertheless be accompanied with sweet seasons, when the Lord will revive us,
and his right hand shall save us from the wrath of all our foes.

=== I will seek that which was lost, and I will bring again that which was driven away, and will bind up that which was broken, and will strengthen that which was sick. Ezekiel 34:16

How lost, and driven away,
how crushed and broken under the headstrong violence of the fleshly will and nature,
is the delicate, lamb-like Spirit of God!
We may say that the whole purpose of God in his dealings with us,
is to seek this divine seed of his own life which is lost,
and to bring it home to the creature which it is appointed to save.
Oh dear soul, unite with your heavenly Father in the search after this ill-used,
neglected, and oppressed one!
And when you have found him,
"`sit down under His shadow,`" and soon will you
find that "`His fruit is sweet`" to your taste.
"`Feed your little goats`" beside the tent of this good shepherd.
Give _Him_ the strength and fire of your nature,
in carrying all its fierceness as your ravenous disease to its physician,
and he will sweetly heal it with his meekness and divine humility.
View him as bruised by your iniquities;
despised and rejected by your inordinate pride and self-love,
and asking admittance into your heart, while you are rushing forth after vanity,
and trampling him under your feet.
Contemplate this, and be humbled in grief,
"`as one that is in bitterness for his first-born.`"

=== In Judah God is known; his name is great in Israel. In Salem also is his tabernacle, and his dwelling place in Zion. There he broke the arrows of the bow, the shield and sword of battle. Psalm 76:1-3

In the holy, serene, humble seed of His own divine nature,
God is to be sought and diligently waited for.
In this secret tabernacle which is deep--very deep
down in the inner sanctuary of the soul,
is His dwelling place.
Here it is, that he covers the believer`'s head "`in the day of battle.`"
Here it is,
that he "`breaks the arrows of the mighty,`" and vanquishes all those
foes which no strength or will of man can detect in their "`hideouts.`"
Wait here then, in simplicity and patience.
Know this Mount Zion which God loves,
where none of "`the mighty men,`" your strong passions, and fierce will,
and all the rough activities of corrupt nature,
can "`find the use of their hands;`" but where they are spoiled,
and at the rebuke of the God of Jacob are cast into the sleep of death.

=== You shall forget your misery, and remember it as waters that pass away. Job 11:16

Musing just now upon a letter written more than fifty years ago,
to a person under deep trial and affliction,
I was led to consider what a transient thing sorrow is.
What now are those troubles which exercised the individual whom the writer of it addressed?
Where are those griefs, and what do they now signify,
except as they might have been the means of purifying
that soul and preparing it for the presence of God?
Yet those troubles and trials were all very real,
and very exercising to those who were called to endure them.
No doubt, they were, _at the time._
But the time itself passes away.
Why, then, need you be anxious, or fret about anything?
"`Be anxious for nothing,`" but just bear, as best you may, the immediate moment`'s grief.
Make it small, by taking it only in the smallness of the present instant.
"`Of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat.`"
There is more in this command than meets the ear;
and it is often a suggestion to my own mind, to _know nothing_ but the moment`'s duty.
Oh, this state of know-nothingness,
this state of "`the babe and suckling,`" how acceptable is it in the sight of God,
and how safe and soothing for the creature!

=== You shall know that your tabernacles shall be in peace; and you shall visit your habitation, and shall not sin (err, margin). Job 5:24

Everything external to us is nothing but a shadow;
and while "`walking in this vain show`" we do, indeed, disquiet ourselves in vain.
We wander in the wilderness in a solitary way, and find no city to dwell in.
We know no shelter in the storm, no refuge from the heat, no place of defence,
when the assault of furious passions, "`that blast of the terrible ones,
is as a storm against the wall.`"

But when the soul has well learned how to wait upon God in inward stillness, it has,
at all times, a habitation to flee unto: a tabernacle to visit,
where the enemy and the avenger cannot come.
It is Salem, the city of peace, where God is known.

Make frequent visits to this tabernacle.
Know it as the secret place of the Most High,
where the shadow of his wing will shelter you; and oh, remember to abide there.
Start not aside like a broken bow; but visit it without sin; that is,
without error in missing the way.

=== The young lions do lack and suffer hunger; but they that seek the Lord, shall not lack any good thing. Psalm 34:10

Know _that_ in your own nature which is appointed of God to suffer hunger, and to die.
It is the fierce, wild, ravenous appetite of self-hood; which,
with its strong propensities like young lions, is always hunting and clamouring for prey.
These are to "`lack and suffer hunger;`" and the pain of their
dying is to be borne quietly and patiently even when nature herself
seems as though she were being slain with them.
Only dwell in the silence, the stillness,
which is "`the land of the living,`" though there appears to be a mighty famine in it.
The famine is only to that which would kill you, if it were not itself killed.
Dwell in this land, and "`verily you shall be fed.`"
Yes, fed with honey out of this strong rock of trial.
God knows how to give food unto his chosen; not such food as man would choose;
not that which cherishes the false life; but bread which comes down from heaven,
and which brings the nature of heaven into the soul that feeds upon it.

=== When Israel was a child, then I loved him, and called my son out of Egypt... I taught Ephraim also to walk. Hosea 11:1, 3

All that is of God, is exceedingly meek, simple, pure, and tender.
His divine and loving Spirit,
"`feeds among the lilies;`" and is ever found in company with whatever is holy, chaste,
and beautiful.
The humble, innocent state of the child, is especially dear to him.
"`He carries the lambs in his bosom,`" as the careful shepherd
guards and carries the helpless ones of his flock.
Ever is he found by the side of the poor tried creature, that desires,
and earnestly looks to him for help.
The cry of "`Abba Father!`"--finds quick entrance into his ears.
Keep then, forever keep near to the child`'s state, which the Lord loves;
and to the docile heart which he "`teaches to walk.`"
Hear and obey every call he makes to you in the circumstances of his Providence,
to come out of Egypt;
out of the bondage in which you are kept to the flesh and to the world.

=== Whenever I am afraid, I will trust in you. Psalm 56:3

Seeing that "`times are not hidden from the Almighty,`"
the duty of the believer is always to trust in him.
The great sustaining promise is, "`as your days, so shall your strength be.`"
Yet unquestionably, the conflict must very often be severe;
since the passion of fear is so mighty and so natural in a sinful being like man.
These bodies of ours are so capable of anguish,
and our souls are so overwhelmed and confused under extreme pain,
though bold enough when all things accord with our desire for enjoyment,
that great indeed are the hindrances in our way to
a secure and abiding confidence in Divine protection.

But, in all our difficulties, doubts, and distresses,
there is absolutely nothing for us in the way of strength and consolation,
but an abiding conviction that our times, our _moments,_ as they come,
are in the hands of God; and therefore,
that they come fraught with indications of his holy will concerning us.
Be it then what it may that befalls you, "`it is the Lord;
let him do what seems to him good.`"
"`Your times are in his hands.`"

Oh, my soul, be strong, be steadfast, and learn with the Apostle this divine lesson;
and know well how and of whom, you have been taught it.
Even though the conflict be sharp and frequent,
and the same dry and barren wilderness has again and again to be passed through,
yet it is the right way, and the only way to the land of peace.
Good is the Lord when he hedges up your way, so that if you would,
you cannot find your paths,
but are bounded on all sides from making shipwreck of yourself.

It is a blessed state when we are constrained by the force of circumstances to sit still,
and learn holy lessons in the school of Christ; and above all,
the lesson which is the crowning one of the rest,
even that of learning to be content in whatever state
it may please Divine Wisdom to place us.
This is a lesson which God alone can teach;
and which the heart that his grace has sanctified alone can learn.

=== Your paths drip with abundance. They drop on the pastures of the wilderness, and the little hills rejoice on every side. Psalm 65:11, 12

This beautiful imagery exhibits the entirely full
and satisfying nature of the Divine Being,
in all his ways of dealing with his creatures.
Truly, they shall be satisfied with the goodness of his house.
We never draw near to him in earnest, and set ourselves in the direction of his paths,
without being made to feel with great clearness and power,
that something of a pure and strengthening influence is imparted to our inner nature,
and that in "`the hidden part we are made to know
wisdom;`" such wisdom as nourishes and satisfies,
and forms stability and strength.
How different is this from any strength and wisdom that we can learn from books!
There, we only read words about it;
here we come to a sensible experience of the thing itself.
There, the mind ravens and hunts, ever seeking, but seldom finding; ever eating,
but seldom fed; seldom refreshed, or changed from strength to strength.
Here is a testimony of what our reading does for us, and that from no ordinary thinker:--

=== You pushed me violently, that I might fall, but the Lord helped me. Psalm 118:13

With respect to our appointed trials, it is hard to say which are the most oppressive,
those that afflict the body, or those that distress the soul.
A disturbed and painful state of body, is perhaps, at the moment,
the hardest to endure patiently,
because of the impediment which is then thrown in the way of that
perfect interior stillness which is in itself healing and consolation.
Thousands of evil spirits seem to rush in when the body is distressed;
and the language of the sufferer may then truly be that of David,
"`you pushed me violently, that I might fall.`"
Still, whether the trial be of soul or body, labour to be patient, and as much as may be,
silent.
It is only a false relief that the sufferer obtains by talking of his pain;
and the time which might be rendered profitable by
inwardly resisting the temptation to speak of it,
is lost in profitless words.
"`The Lord sits above the waterfloods:`" and he will assuredly, in his own good time,
put down those that push you violently, and will help you.

=== The backslider in heart shall be filled with his own ways; and a good man shall be satisfied from himself. Proverbs 14:14

It is by allowing ourselves to slide back into old thoughts and habits of mind,
that we get so filled with our own ways,
and that there is no room in us for the entrance of that
pure word which gives understanding to the simple.
"`The wisdom of the prudent is to understand his way;`" to know what he is doing,
and what sort of building he is raising within his own inner world.
"`You are God`'s building,`" says the Apostle.
Be it so then.
Let God build you up.
"`Through wisdom a house is built, and by understanding it is established;
by knowledge the rooms are filled with all precious and pleasant riches.`"
"`I will fill their treasures,`" says this divine wisdom,
and "`I will cause those that love me to inherit substance.`"
And truly,
when the soul is thus furnished with "`durable riches,`"
and is stored with pleasant fruits,
it finds that it _is_ satisfied from itself.
It is not filled with its own ways, but with those of that blessed Teacher,
whose "`ways are ways of pleasantness, and all whose paths are peace.`"

Who is there that sincerely desires to be "`cleansed from secret faults,`" that

"`My soul clings to the dust!`"
Lord, you know my desire, and my groaning is not hidden from you.
You know that in the better part of me,
I would readily cast away these idols of the fleshly mind to the moles and to the bats.
But the inferior part is strong: and it clings to old memories, and old ties,
and old joys, and thus "`clings to the dust.`"

It may be so; still you must not despond.
God has long had patience with you, and you must have patience with yourself.
It is something, yes, it is much, that you are sensible of,
and do mourn over these frailties of nature.
Resist them to the uttermost; stand fast in the faith;
and God will surely grant you a clean deliverance from all your enemies and his,
and make you alive to a new and holy life, "`according to his word.`"

=== They waited not for his counsel; but lusted exceedingly in the wilderness... And he gave them their request, but sent leanness into their soul. Psalm 106:13, etc.

Always stand on your guard against that ruinous haste to act which is
_sure_ to beset the mind when any tempting object is presented to it.
Most certain of suffering are you, when, in eagerness to _be doing,_
you wait not for God`'s counsel.
Remember, that it is when the cross offers itself, that it alone can be taken up.
There is no act of self-denial, or self-subjugation,
in _reading_ excellent and wise things in praise thereof.
The right path is a beautiful and pleasant path to look at, when temptation is absent;
but the aspect it presents is different,
when on each side of it there are "`pleasant pictures`"
which duty forbids you to gaze at.
Nevertheless,
_now_ is the time for you to prove and examine yourself whether you be in the faith,
and in the reality of the life of God;
or whether it is only fluctuating notions of its
beauty and desirableness that float in your head,
without ruling in your heart.

Everything desirable has its price; and it is well said by some author,
that "`the pleasures of virtue are paid for beforehand; and those of the world,
afterwards.`"
There _must_ be suffering in the flesh before it will submit to be governed by the Spirit.
"`Arm yourself,`" therefore.
"`Be strong, and very courageous.`"
Be opposed continually to your inferior, fleshly, animal mind and will.
Thus, you will gradually learn to cease from your own works, your own wisdom,
and your own way; all of which, as your own, can never be free from pollution,
because they can never be free from that taint of sin and
corruption which forms the falsehood of the natural life.
This _must_ die.

=== Offer the sacrifices of righteousness, and put your trust in the Lord. Psalm 4:5

In coming to wait upon God in silence,
we must be prepared to offer the sacrifices of righteousness in the firm and
constant slaughter of every wandering thought that presents itself to the mind.
We read that the first covenant was made with blood,
which Moses took and sprinkled upon the people; "`for without shedding of blood,
there is no remission of sin; and almost all things are purified by blood.`"
It is a deep and divine truth that is typified here!
The blood we are called to shed in offering up the sacrifices of righteousness,
is spiritual; the blood shed by the soul in slaying its beasts,
which are its corrupt desires, and vain thoughts.
These are the righteous offerings with which the Lord is well pleased;
and when he sees us sprinkled with their blood,
he accepts it as the "`blood of the _new_ covenant,`" and
he sends forth "`his prisoners,`" our captive souls,
"`out of the pit wherein is no water`" Zechariah
9:11. "`You have not yet resisted unto blood,
striving against sin,`" said the Apostle,
in urging his brethren to greater endurance and greater faith.

We are told that "`gold is tried in the fire,
and acceptable men in the furnace of adversity;`" and the experience
of every child of God abundantly confirms this truth.
There _must_ be times of trial; times of probation,
to show "`what sort of work`" we have been about, in that which we call our religion.
For, we must ever remember, that it is one thing to have a religion,
and another to have a work that will stand the fire.
Unquestionably,
passing through a furnace must be agonizing to the transitory life of nature;
but to the life which is supernatural, to the holy birth which is of the Spirit,
it is the way, and the only way, to freedom and peace.
"`Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty.`"
Liberty from the galling slavery of the will; from the restless,
disorderly workings of the passions; liberty to attend to,
and to enjoy the passing moment, without fruitless reminiscences of the past,
or anxious desires for the future;
and if it be suffering that the present moment calls us to,
there the disengaged mind is best fitted to endure it with simplicity and faith.

To believe this as an influential truth,

We profess to believe it every time we give utterance to the petition,
"`your kingdom come.`"
But the great matter is, to know where that kingdom is to be sought.
"`The kingdom of God is within you.`"
This decides that question.
Aim, therefore, to know your King exalted upon his throne in your conscience,
and there giving forth the divine sentence which never transgresses in judgment;
never calls evil good, or sweet bitter, but judges righteously.

"`The kingdom is the Lord`'s;`" and great is the wisdom
of daily feeling a translation into this holy domain;
and of knowing that the King is sitting on his throne,
and sending forth the law that converts the soul,
and is ruling in the midst of his enemies,
and separating between the precious and the vile,

It is grievous to think what devastation is often made among the

The disease of fallen nature is violence, bitterness, and harshness.
A screaming, fractious child exemplifies this very vividly as a truth.
The remedy for this disease is another life and nature exactly opposed to it;
and which is found in the gift of God`'s Holy Spirit.
This in all its motions is gentle, calm, and meek,
and consequently well fitted to tranquilize the fire and force,
that so often break out in rash deeds, and in words that are _not_ pleasant.
_Feel after_ that which loves peace, and which prompts to the pursuit of it;
and which turns away from all evil speaking,
and in every assault of bitter tempers points to peace and healing.

__Healing--__remember that that is what our poor diseased souls continually stand in need of.
Forever then, avoid to pour into the leprosy of sin, the sharp,
fiery stream of bitter words.

"`The wisdom of this world is foolishness with God;`"
let it then be as foolishness to us,
when it usurps any authority in attempting to influence us in things that are spiritual.
It has no knowledge, no light, no part nor portion in those things.

And equally as we stand aloof from the wisdom of the world,
let us keep clear from being entangled in any of the reasonings of our own minds;
which sometimes present themselves with a great show of strength,
and ask for consideration with much plausibility.
But they are only empty beggars for notice;
and disturbers of things far better worth attending to,
than any which they have to propose.

=== The meek shall increase their joy in the Lord, and the poor among men shall rejoice in the Holy One of Israel. Isaiah 29:19

Nothing that has not the stamp of permanence upon it,
can possibly satisfy the soul of man; because what is transitory,
can never suffice for that which is immortal.
We have often, no doubt, proved this in the passing away of many beautiful things, which,
before their arrival,
had seemed to us of that exquisite kind which must have rendered them "`joys forever.`"
But "`joy in the Lord,`" is the only joy of that kind.
This indeed, never satiates, but being both ancient and new,
it meets the need of the creature with its appropriate
supply out of the infinite fulness of the Creator.
All that is requisite to obtain a share in this fulness,
is the prescribed character and disposition.
And here it is laid down.
The meek in heart, the poor, God`'s poor, which means not the poverty of the purse,
which is no hindrance to pride of heart, but the poor in spirit;
these are they who shall "`increase their joy in the Lord,

=== Let your eyes look right on, and let your eyelids look straight before you. Proverbs 4:25

There is a power in being inwardly focused that can spiritualize the mind,
which is totally inconceivable till it has been experimentally understood.
The habit of fixing the attention upon the matter in hand, in a worldly sense,
is well enough understood;
because persons of the utmost mediocrity of mind soon discover that this must be practised,
in order to accomplish anything.
But the necessity for pursuing this fixity in relation to our soul`'s concerns,
is too much overlooked,
even by persons who are sincerely desirous of finding out the way of truth and righteousness.
So much more stress is usually laid upon outward, than inward devotional exercises,
that the habit of observing what is passing in the thoughts is but little remembered.
Yet, here the root of the matter lies, like all roots, deep out of sight;
and when we become "`rooted and grounded`" in the life of truth,
we can understand the comprehensiveness of the few words which are now before us;

Saint Paul speaks of "`the righteousness which is of God by faith.`"
Now, there must be a precise, well defined, well understood object of faith,
before there can possibly be any influential belief in it.
What is this righteousness of God then, which is made ours by an act of faith?
Surely, in the words of the text, we have a most lucid and divine description of it.
Christ Jesus, by the power of His Spirit,
works _in us_ all the spiritual goodness whereby we partake of a new birth unto righteousness.
He turns us from the power of darkness unto light, from folly to wisdom,
from unrighteousness to holiness, and from corruption to purity.
He delivers us from a condition of slavery to sin and Satan,
and redeems us from their house of bondage.

He effects all these mercies and privileges for us, not in the way of a notion,
which imputes something to us of which we have no real experience; but by an inward,
spiritual grace given unto us which we perceive and feel; and which,
as we are obedient to it,
becomes "`the power of God unto salvation,`" in redeeming us from all iniquity,
and making us "`vessels sanctified and useful for the master.`"

Indeed they do; but alas, too often in vain!
Yet, in the midst of the clamour and confusion that fill the world,
the heart of man remains the same solitary, sinful, and suffering thing.
And still within its silent depths, there dwells a little seed of everlasting life,
a small portion of that divine nature which is capable not only of hearing,
but of loving and of obeying the voice of wisdom.
To this, "`the least of all seeds,`" she addresses herself.
Blessed are they who hearken to her words,
and cherish as the apple of their eye the smallest yearnings they may feel for her instructions.

=== Every wise woman builds her house; but the foolish plucks it down with her hands. Proverbs 14:1

Under the figure of a female,
it is not uncommon for the writers of the Old Testament
to designate some spiritual condition or faculty.
Thus, in Proverbs 5:3, speaking of the lips of the strange woman that "`drip honey,
and her mouth is smoother than oil,`" we may recognize the false spirit of this world,
always fluctuating, and always deceiving, and assailing us perpetually,
on the impulsive and coveting side of our nature.
Shifting, and unstable, "`lest you should ponder the path of life,
her ways are always movable, so that you can not know them.`"
This is the false nature which is to be denied.
And here in the text the true spirit is alluded to,
as the "`wise woman that builds her house;`" that is to say,
the sincere and earnest follower of God,
who builds his inner man into a tabernacle for the indwelling of the Holy Spirit,
and thus comes to establishment and reality in the divine life.

=== Remove far from me vanity and lies. Proverbs 30:8

It is deeply instructive to observe, and to think awhile upon the observation,
how exactly the enlightened mind aims at the same point,
pursues the same train of thought, and entertains the same views of things,
at every period of time, and under every variety of external circumstances.

Some thousands of years ago,
we find a man of wisdom and reflection giving utterance to this supplication;
and good as it was for that age, equally good is it for this in which we live.
Any man of thought and reflection would just as earnestly offer it up now,
as Agar did in his day.
And why?
Because at all times and in all places,
vanity and lies are the snares by which the adversary of our souls draws us into his net;
and by which misery, and sin, and shame overtake and overwhelm mankind.
They do not present themselves to us as vanity and lies.
Oh no, no! "`Surely in vain is the net spread in the sight of any bird.`"
It is because of their subtlety,
because of our inability to detect and cope with their artifice,
that our only safety is to be found in fervently beseeching the
Lord to "`remove far from us vanity and lies;`" which He does by
enlightening the conscience to perceive their nature of falsehood.
Always remember that the _sight_ of sin is a command to forsake it.
Keep the inward eye, therefore, single and sincere, that it may be full of light.

=== The name of the Lord is a strong tower, the righteous runs into it and is safe. Proverbs 18:10

"`The name of the Lord`" is a Scriptural expression of very frequent occurrence;
and it behooves us clearly to understand what it signifies.
Simply regarded as a _name,_ it is mystical and obscure; but, contemplated as a _nature,_
which no doubt is the right way of regarding it,
it opens up to us a glorious field of thought.
For what is the nature of God as revealed in Holy Writ?
"`GOD IS LOVE.`"
"`He that loves not, knows not God; for God is Love.`"
Again: "`God is Light.`"
Into this holy name and nature, in all his trials, "`the righteous runs and is safe.`"
Is he fiercely assaulted with unholy desires, with evil tempers,
or with any of the snares which the prince of this world may lay in his way?
He hastens to his strong tower, he hides himself in the meek, the pure,
the loving nature of his heavenly Father,
and in the clear rectitude of the divine light he sees and shuns the snares of the adversary,
and is saved from all evil, and all danger.

=== To deliver you from the strange woman, even from the stranger which flatters with her words. Proverbs 2:16

It is a vast matter to be delivered from that insidious Babylonish spirit,
which deceives the whole world; "`the strange woman which flatters with her words.`"
Do you not know something of her blandishments?
Did you never hear her whispering words of flattery in your ear?
Oh, it is a priceless possession to inherit _truth,_ and to have that within us which,
presenting all things according to their real nature,
throws a shield between our souls and their numerous enemies.
Amidst these, none are so dangerous, none so entirely to be dreaded,
as those that come in the guise of admirers and flatterers.
"`Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ; which,
according to His abundant mercy,
has begotten us again unto a lively hope;`" and "`to an inheritance incorruptible,
and undefiled, and that fades not away.`"
We have a foretaste of this inheritance even here, in the possession of truth;
the highest, and the noblest of the gifts of God.
Evermore prize it according to its value;
and resort to it as your appointed deliverer from all the sorceries of the strange woman,
the lying spirit that works in the children of disobedience.

=== My beloved is gone down into his garden, to the beds of spices; to feed in the gardens and to gather lilies. I am my beloved`'s, and my beloved is mine; he feeds among the lilies. Canticles 6:2-3

There is only one tie that can link the soul of the
creature to the Creator in a union of joy,
and that is, love.
God abstracted from His nature of love,
can only be terrible to us from the awful Immensity of His being; but,
regarded as the source of love, what is there of beauty and sweetness,
that the thought of belonging to Him does not excite in the mind?
So exquisite, indeed, is the rapture which this view of Him imparts,
that the soul has then the witness in itself, that it belongs to the Lord;
and in the ecstasy of this sweet consciousness can say,
"`I am my beloved`'s and my beloved is mine.`"
And then the blessed bridegroom rejoices in his spouse,
and goes down into the garden of the sanctified heart,
and gathers the lovely lilies of purified and sweet affections,
which His own grace has planted.

=== The Lord God is a sun and shield; the Lord will give grace and glory; no good thing will he withhold from them that walk uprightly. Psalm 84:11

A sun to enlighten, a shield to protect, such is the Lord God with whom we have to do.
"`No good thing will He withhold from those that walk uprightly;`" although in His wisdom
and mercy He may see fit to withhold many things which the natural heart may love,
and long for.
He knows far better than we do what is good,
and especially what is good for us individually.
That may be a dangerous and bad thing for a person of a particular temperament,
which would be even good for another who is of a different disposition.

How blessed is it for us that we are not permitted to be
our own choosers as to the gifts withheld or bestowed!
Enough, that this is promised us:
"`no good thing,`" nothing that is really desirable for us will God withhold,
while we walk before Him in uprightness of heart.
Help us then, O God of our salvation, to the goodness of which we stand in need,
to secure Your favour and protection!

=== Wisdom and knowledge shall be the stability of your times, and strength of salvation. Isaiah 33:6

It is for the most part but a low and obscure idea of salvation that persons entertain;
though, when rightly understood,
it is a term which comprises the proper business of human life.
For, there is no moment of our lives in which we do not stand in need of being saved
from those ensnaring seductions of the senses which lie perpetually in our path.

Continually, we require far higher wisdom than any we possess in ourselves,
to reveal to us the profitless wanderings of fancy,
and the various shadows which we take for substance, and which, in seeking to grasp,
we scatter, and lose our mental strength.
"`The grace of God which brings salvation,`" reveals to us our various dangers;
and as we obey the light thus acting in our behalf,
we get acquainted with divine wisdom and knowledge,
and can distinctly recognize the strength of our salvation.

=== You are beautiful, O my love! Canticles 6:4

How exquisite is moral beauty!
Indefinable, but soul-satisfying, how divine is it!
God, who has made us to be satiated with joy,
is himself the Fountain that is to fill us with delight.
Never, O never, let any feeling but that of adoring love accompany the thought of Him!
He is not only beautiful, but beauty itself.
O, fill your soul with hope and happiness at the thought!
What is your life, what are your faculties, what is anything you can delight in, worth,
except as it ministers to your joy in Him who is the Fountain of all perfection?

Very near to you, though secret and inaccessible to the searching of your intellect,
is the Father of Spirits; and you are to grope for him,
in the hope that you may find him; but, grope not with shrinking and fear,
for fear has torment: grope only with the tender heart that seeks its dearest,
its best of friends.
"`You are beautiful,`" it says, "`O meekest of Guides!
Let me hear your voice, let me see your countenance; for sweet is your voice,
and your countenance is comely!`"

=== Judgment also will I lay to the line, and righteousness to the plummet; and the hail shall sweep away the refuge of lies, and the waters shall overflow the hiding place. Isaiah 28:17

There is a time when judgment is sure to overtake us,
and when all our "`pleasant pictures,`" all our temporal and transitory resources,
will present themselves to us as a mere "`refuge of lies,`"
which the hail storm of affliction will sweep away.
This must be meekly and patiently received, and submitted to.
Happy are those whose habits of life have been such as to cause them to
have but little to surrender to the stroke of the Lord`'s hand.
A stroke, let us remember, which chastens in mercy and lovingkindness.
We never know our real standing in the life of truth,
till we are put into the furnace of trial.
God will have us to be made holy, as the first step to our being made happy;
and holiness can only enter our nature through the slaying of all impurity and sin;
and we know that a work of death must be a work of pain.

=== The kingdom of Heaven is like a treasure hidden in a field, which a man found and hid; and for joy over it he goes and sells all that he has and buys that field. Matthew 13:44

The "`treasure hidden in a field,`" which is the joy of the soul that finds it,
is only overlooked because of its nearness, and because of what we, in our ignorance,
are apt to consider its insignificance.
But now, as ever, "`this stone which the builders rejected,
must become the chief cornerstone.`"
It is set aside under the name and notion of mere natural conscience,
the dictates of reason, and so on.
But that which saves from sin,
that which directs the human being into a mode of conducting himself the complete
opposite direction of all that his natural will and wishes would point to,
which subdues, instead of yielding to, and indulging his self-hood, _this,_
call it by what name you will, is no part of the man himself.
It is "`that least of all seeds`" which is divine in its origin,
and which is bestowed upon us as the means, and the only means,
whereby we can be made partakers of the divine nature.

=== Everyone that does evil hates the light, neither comes to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved. But he that does truth comes to the light; that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God. John 3:20-21

We have the means of genuine happiness in our own hands, if we choose to seek for them.
They do not, indeed, lie upon the surface; neither are they found without diligent search.
But they are within the soul, as everything is, be it good or bad,
that makes up the living experience that forms our history.
Truth or falsehood, pleasure or pain, with the presence of one or the other of these,
our existence is always interacting.
And just as darkness or light prevails in the atmosphere of our minds,
do good or evil feelings prevail in our affections.
Do you love the light?
Do you bring your thoughts, words, and deeds to it?
If you do, you are honest in your dealing with God; and so far you are happy,
and cannot possibly be otherwise; for you are in unity with Truth,
which is always in unity with Him.

=== I said I will take heed to my ways, that I sin not with my tongue; I will keep my mouth with a bridle, while the wicked is before me. Psalm 39:1

It is not from the bodily tongue that the chief danger of sin is to be feared,
but from that inward member which so often consults
with the wicked in the deep recesses within the soul.
It is good to take heed to our ways _here;_
and to establish a habit of watching the current of our thoughts.
When we do this with earnestness and perseverance,
we shall come to such a clear perception of our spiritual foes,
and the snares by which they assail us, as will be found quite a new revelation of truth.
For truth, as it concerns us to seek the possession of it, is the knowledge of ourselves.
It is a science therefore, which, beyond all others most behooves us to be skilled in.
But the way to acquire this skill is difficult.
The words of the text suggest a great help towards learning it, by pointing us to deep,
interior stillness,
while the wicked (and what wickedness is so much
to be dreaded as wicked thoughts?) is before us.

=== Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. Matthew 5:3

Those who have "`tasted that the Lord is gracious,`" will
be unanimous in testifying that it is poverty of spirit,
which, more than any other grace, attracts the sweet visitations of his favour;
and which diffuses "`an anointing from the holy one`" over the soul,
which it is quite beyond the power of any natural joy to bestow.^

that over his tomb was an inscription in Latin,
which is thus translated into English by one of his historians:
`    "`Say where is Peace, for you its paths have trod.`"
     "`In poverty, retirement, and with God.`" `]

No quality is so totally in opposition to the vehemence, the pride, the eagerness,
the entire nature of the unregenerate heart, as humility; and hence,
it is so hard a thing to bring that heart into the
state of submission to which it _must_ be brought,
before the teachings of the Spirit of God can effectually renew it unto life and holiness.
The strength of the will and of the intellectual powers, have a service to perform;
but the nature of God, and the joy of his salvation,
are revealed to the tenderness of the affections,
and to these only as they are sanctified by meekness and humility.

=== We all, with open face, beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord. 2 Cor. 3:18

The subjects which engage the attention, and attract the affections of the human being,
have a secret potency in stamping an image or reflection of themselves upon his nature.
We grow into a resemblance of that with which our will strongly assimilates itself;
for "`as the man thinks, so is he.`"
It is therefore our strongest interest, as well as our highest privilege,
to familiarize our minds with pure and divine contemplations; since thus,
"`beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord,`" contemplating the sweetness,
the beauty, the perfection of His nature,
and earnestly breathing to His Spirit "`the Lord and Giver of life,`"
to open up within us "`the new creature`" that "`hungers and thirsts
after righteousness,`" we grow in the nature that is holy and divine;
and, through the operation of our heavenly Father`'s grace, are changed into His image,
and proceed "`from glory to glory, as by the Spirit of the Lord.`"

=== Blessed is the man that endures temptation, for when he is tried he shall receive the crown of life which the Lord has promised to them that love him. James 1:12

The astonishing labyrinth of evil in which we find ourselves, is,
when rightly understood, but the dark background to infinite good.
It is indeed,

[verse]
____
A mighty maze, but not without a plan.
____

The patient endurance of adversity,
the recognition of a divine hand and a divine purpose in the infliction of it,
and a steadfast resistance to the snares which inbred corruption, outward temptation,
and the cruel assaults of evil spirits throw across our path,
appear to present a condition which--however it may be divested of "`form
and comeliness`" to the superficial observer--the testimony of Scripture,
and that of the believer Himself, pronounce to be blessed.
The witness within assures the individual thus tried, and thus established in faith,
that not one of his offerings of will and wish shall be lost;
but that he shall assuredly find them again in the crown of life which
the Lord has in store for him in another and a happier stage of existence.

=== Knowledge puffs up, but love edifies. 1 Cor. 8:1

It is worthy of remark that the first temptation presented to the human race,
came in the form of a promise of the gift of knowledge: "`You shall be as gods,
knowing good and evil.`"
Now, it is true that for "`the soul to be without knowledge is not good`" (Prov.
19:2);
and no one who wishes well to his fellow creatures would debar them from the
acquisition of that kind and degree of it which is adapted to their circumstances.
But the sort of knowledge which should supersede every other, is the knowledge of God,
of his holy will concerning us, and of our duty in fulfilling it.
When this is the groundwork of education,
there is hope that the mind may profit by the other
kinds of knowledge which may be presented to it.
But till this basis of truth is established, the knowledge that is obtained,
is only too likely to "`puff up`" the individual with undue exaltation.
We may reasonably believe that this kind of knowledge
is too rife in these stirring times in which we live.
Science indeed flourishes; and so do suicides, bankruptcies, and skillful frauds.
People have much knowledge; but the love that edifies,
is greatly a stranger upon the earth.

=== Thus says the Lord your Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel; I am the Lord your God which teaches you to profit, which leads you by the way that you should go. Isaiah 48:17

The lessons of instruction from our Redeemer the Holy One of Israel,
by which he "`teaches us to profit,`" are to be observed (as it respects
us personally) very carefully in the circumstances of our lot,
and the leadings of Providence by which it is directed.
On few points are people so willfully blind as on this.
They wish things to take a particular turn;
and so it is very easy to fancy that they _do_ turn, in the desired direction.
But, very often, we have cause to believe, that in the ordering our way,
the will of God is not found to be accordant with ours, in respect to our outward lot;
and in His "`leading us by the way that we should go,`" we shall find
ourselves turned directly contrary to the wish and will of our minds.
It is not to be said that this is so constantly the case,
as to justify our making it into a rule of conduct;
but it should certainly be considered as a reason for great caution,
and for much patience before taking steps in life.

=== A just weight and balance are the Lord`'s. Proverbs 16:11

It is remarkable that,
while some degree of trouble in practising the rules
of whatever art or science we desire to understand,
is so essential as to be taken for granted, and never questioned,
or disregarded as a preliminary;
yet with respect to learning what the Scriptures term "`the
way of the Lord,`" or His mind and will concerning us,
nobody appears to suppose that anything is necessary but to be able to read,
in order that we may study what is said about it in the Bible.
This is necessary, no doubt;
but we must read the statements of the Bible in our own hearts and consciences,
much more constantly than in the book,
or we shall be but little better for studying them.
To know what they mean as it respects _us_ is the great matter.
Here we are told that "`a just weight and balance are the Lord`'s;`" by which we infer,
that the Lord requires rectitude of heart in those who profess to serve Him.
Nor is it merely the "`just weight and balance`" in commercial dealings,
that the Lord claims as His due;
but "`the just weight`" that keeps the soul duly
balanced in the way of uprightness and integrity.

=== Strengthened with all might according to his glorious power, unto all patience, and longsuffering with joyfulness. Colossians 1:11

The vast problem of the origin and prevalence of evil, it is not ours to solve,
but to endure.
And when we place ourselves in the right position of mind, encountering it properly,
we shall not fail to perceive that,
strange and appalling as it is to our natural faculties,
there is a gift of a supernatural kind in the soul of the tried believer,
which enables him to discern that affliction--when sanctified by the grace
of God--is just the sublimest and most glorious thing in the world.
And while he is meekly endeavouring to submit to the will of God,
he does most truly find himself "`strengthened with all might,
according to the glorious power`" bestowed upon him by his Heavenly Helper:
and that the ineffable sweetness which humility and patience shed over his spirit,
renders his sufferings a source of solemn joy, which, in its deep serenity,
administers to him comfort and consolation of the most sustaining kind.

=== O send out your light and your truth, let them lead me; let them bring me unto your holy hill, and to your tabernacle. Psalm 43:3

How precious is it when the soul can sincerely breathe this Heavenly prayer!
And what need hinder it of this holy desire?
The flesh, the carnal mind with its "`many gods, and many lords,`" this is the hindrance;
and a deadly, and an insurmountable one it is.
O soul that ponders upon this divine prayer,
if you are held in bondage to this carnal mind which serves the law of sin,
and which from its very nature, can never serve anything else;
"`shake yourself from the dust;
loose the bands of your neck;`" and send up these life-giving words with
earnest desire to Him who "`waits to be gracious,`" and who yearns to
grant you a clean deliverance from the yoke that bows you to the dust.
Let it be your fervent supplication, "`O send out your light and your truth,
let _them_ lead me.`"
Let me no longer be _misled_ by my own blind passions nor by "`the rulers of the
darkness of this world who work in them,`" but reveal to me your light,
O God of light, and your Truth, O Fountain of Truth,
that they may guide me to your dwelling-place in my soul.

this lovely tabernacle which David panted after is to be found.
Oh, how divinely serene is that ark of rest,
in which God and the soul dwell sweetly together!
Here is the pure Jerusalem that "`comes down from
Heaven as a bride adorned for her husband.`"
Here are the green pastures and the still waters!
Here is the feeding on the hidden manna; and here is the safe lying down,
where none can make afraid, because no evil can come near this dwelling.
Here are the courts of the Lord, of which the redeemed soul says, it "`longs, yes,
even faints`" for them.
O, thus should it ever be!
Thus it is that the loving Father of life would have
His children to cry out in "`heart and flesh,

The knowledge of truth is the very highest blessing that the human being can receive.
But now, as in the days of old, and as in all time, the query has to be made,
of "`what is truth?`"
"`Your Word is truth.`"
Yes, but _what_ word?
"`The written word,`" is the usual reply with every
sect of religionists except indeed the Quakers.
_They_ profess to understand by the Word of God, that "`which was from the beginning;
which was with God, and which was God;`" but their profession, in this respect,
is not now what it once was.

It is this holy, ever living, ever present Word _in the heart,_
which is the Sanctifier and Redeemer of the soul.
"`Your Word,`" says David, "`have I hidden in my heart,
that I might not sin against You.`"
It is through watching closely and continuously the
leadings and restrainings of this interior Word,
that the soul proceeds from strength to strength,
till it is so imbued with the life and power of truth,
as to be delivered from becoming the victim of manifold
deceits and that cunning craftiness of evil beings,
whereby those who are _out_ of the truth, are perpetually ensnared.

If the work of religion were merely that which the

that is to say,
if it consisted only in a steady observance of certain rules and ceremonies,
it would be a very easy matter indeed.

But all the outwardness of religion is only its shell; and too often its sepulchre.
We must look _within_ to know how it fares with us as to the reality of our faith;
and we must bring our interior condition to the test
which the apostle offers us in this statement.

Am I in any distinct and perceptible form a new creature in Christ?
Do I recognise in my habits, and conduct, and modes of thought,
the power of His transforming Spirit?
Do I sensibly perceive the passing away of old things, old tempers, old sins;
and the substitution of new and holy feelings and actions in their place?
Honest replies to such queries as these would lead us to much useful self-knowledge.

In these two verses of Scripture we are presented with a graphic picture of soul experience;
and one which must be well understood, and deeply sympathized with,
by all those whom the Lord has led to the knowledge
of his truth through sharp and manifold exercises.
"`I waited patiently for the Lord.`"
I was inwardly still and silent, and patiently breathing to him for help;
and he inclined unto me, and as the mother hears the wailing of her helpless child,
he heard my cry, and brought me up out of the horrible pit, or,
as it reads in the margin,
"`a pit of noise;`" even that dark and noisy dungeon of the carnal mind,
where I was imprisoned, as it were, in miry clay; in the stiff adhesiveness,
and stunned with the clamour, of earthly and evil thoughts and feelings.
I sank down, away from these, into patient longing and sighing for the Lord,
and he brought me forth into light, and liberty, and life.
Amen!

Isaiah 30:20-21

The bread of adversity, and the water of affliction, are God`'s medicines;
and happy are those who receive them as such from
the hand of the only physician of value.
It is through the discipline which these administer,
that the soul comes to know its teachers, and to understand the language which they use.
To the ungodly and the worldly-minded, there are no teachers and no teaching,
and no knowledge that they care to hear, or that, in a spiritual sense, benefits them.
They may be made crafty and cautious as to their worldly interests,
by the experience which their various misdoings may have supplied them with;
but they are never enlightened by the lessons of the Almighty;
and never skillful in discerning what these teachers say to them.

=== That was the true light which gives light to every man coming into the world. John 1:9

In every human being that is at all raised by civilization above savage life,
there is something to be perceived in his mind which
is higher in its nature than his animal self-hood;
and which often meets him in his doings, with wonderful power of rebuke and warning.
More especially in that reaction which succeeds to the indulgence of the passions,
is the "`still small voice`" of this interior companion distinctly to be heard;
and in his light,
which "`makes manifest,`" are clearly to be perceived
many things which had hitherto been concealed.
Strange and profitless queries are sometimes raised as to
the nature and role of this light which shines in the conscience;
all of which might be spared,
if we would be content to receive this simple definition of it.
It is a _true_ light; that is its nature;
and its role is to enlighten and inform the dark and ignorant soul of man;
which would be incomplete indeed in its appointments,
if in the midst of so much misery and mystery as that in which it finds itself,
it had not something bestowed upon it that was wiser and better than itself.

"`Whom the Lord loves, He chastens;`" and there is no loss so totally grievous,
as losing the benefit which He designs for us in the visitation of affliction.
"`You have stricken them, but they have not grieved.`"
No; the proud mind resists all succumbing to sorrow.
But what says the Spirit of the Lord concerning such as these?
Surely they are poor; they are foolish; for they know not the way of the Lord,
nor the judgment of their God!
O, forever observe the way of the Lord in His corrections.

We lose much of the power and beauty of this divine Scripture,

dismissal at the close of the church service.
But when we can divest our minds of the customary associations with which it is connected,
and meditate upon its comprehensiveness,
with respect to all we can desire of benefit and blessing,
there is great profit to be derived from the study of it.

"`The peace of God!`"
How different a peace is this from any of the peace which
flows from our own endeavours after rest and contentment.
It is a peace which grants us a foretaste of "`the
powers of the world to come,`" the kingdom of peace.
It is a peace which passes the power of the natural faculties of man to understand.
It is a peace which is in the possession only of the believer; and being his,
it keeps his heart and mind in their right state, calm, equable, holy, and happy,
garrisoned, as it were, in immovable tranquillity.

No desolation is so terrible as that of being without any knowledge of God.
Yet, alas!
This is the condition of the greater part of the human race.
For a time, perhaps during a life extended to three score and ten years,
this fearful loneliness of soul is undetected.

The society, the amusements, the occupations of the world, keep all reflection at bay,
and nothing is so little known, or so little cared for by the individual,
as the state of his own soul in relation to God.
But some stroke of adversity, it may be the loss of health,
or loss of friends and fortune, drives him inward for counsel or for comfort;
but all is found to be in confusion and a chaos of misery there.
He discovers that he has lost his time in serving himself;
and that he has now that bad and insufficient master upon his hands.
Much does it behoove us therefore "`today,
while it is called today,`" to seek the Friend who never
allows the soul that trusts in him to be desolate.

=== The highway of the upright is to depart from evil; he that keeps his way, preserves his soul. Proverbs 16:17

We are placed between good and evil, between life and death, flesh and spirit;

Every life has a leader, or predominating influence that governs it.
The mere instincts and appetites of their nature combine
to influence and lead the life of the brute creation.
Is it much better with many who are to be classed with rational beings?
If it is, it is only as they understand,
and keep themselves in the highway of the upright, by departing from evil.
Deeply consider what is comprehended in that saying,
"`he that keeps his way preserves his soul.`"
"`How can a young man cleanse his way?
By taking heed according to your word.`"
We are always proceeding on the path of life in some way, good or bad.
Is it in the highway of the upright?
Is it watchfully, carefully, and with an earnest endeavour, when evil is detected,
to avoid it, to pass not near it, but to keep our souls from all contact with it?

=== And my people shall dwell in a peaceable habitation, and in sure dwellings, and in quiet resting-places. Isaiah 32:18

There is a deep response in every reflecting mind to the entire
satisfaction which these words promise to the servant of the Lord.

Such a one feels it to be the highest gratification of which his nature is capable,
to have God for his friend; God, as the orderer of his lot,
the provider of his happiness.
He has, in the testimony of his own spirit,
an assurance that he _shall_ dwell in a peaceable habitation and lie down in a quiet resting-place,
where none of the storms of the passions, no assaults from evil spirits,
and none of the snares and temptations of the world
can break in to disturb and scatter him.
Yes; the enlightened soul is taught to know with holy joy and gratitude,
that in this precious promise is enfolded all that
he needs for solace and for encouragement here,
and as an object of hope hereafter.

=== O Lord, by these things men live; and in all these things is the life of my spirit. Isaiah 38:16

What were these things in which Hezekiah found the life of his spirit?
Were they not just those things which are the destruction of the flesh,
the soul`'s greatest enemy?
It was of sickness, of sorrow, of distress so overwhelming,
that he said of his condition, "`my eyes fail with looking upward.
O Lord, I am oppressed, undertake for me.`"
It was of trial the deepest that could overtake him, that he was yet able to testify,
"`O Lord, by these things men live.`"

And true was his testimony!
It is out of these things that human beings take their holiest lessons.
It is through the wounding and slaying of their low animal joys and comforts,
that room is made in the soul for the growth of the new heart and
the new spirit to which the favour of the Lord is extended.
This is the heart and spirit which understands and
blesses the purpose of God in sending it affliction;
and which recognizes such a divine virtue in adversity,
that it meekly rejoices as it takes the cup of sorrow, and says of it, "`O Lord,
by these things men live!`"

=== That he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word. Eph. 5:26

The Word of God _inwardly_ cleansing the soul "`from all its filthiness,
and from all its idols,`" is just the whole life
and power of that which we call our religion.
Remedy,
is that which it provides for the ravages which sin has occasioned in our moral nature.
Everywhere it is supposed to denote a healing, a redeeming, and a saving process,
in behalf of something that is weak, unsound, unhealthy, and in danger of enemies.
We know that this is the soul of man; which,
till the grace of God has renewed it to life and health, is broken, diseased, and feeble,
in what ought to be its highest and noblest capabilities;
even the power of loving and serving God.
It is weak in conscience, weak in its love of truth and holiness,
weak in its hatred of evil,
and only strong in "`the corrupt and deceitful lusts,`"
which enlist it in the service of the world,
the flesh, and the devil.

=== Whosoever drinks of the water that I shall give him, shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him, shall be in him a well of water springing up unto everlasting life. John 4:14

The soul which has been favoured to know the blessedness of "`a time of
refreshing from the presence of the Lord,`" can understand these words,
for such a one has experienced the entire satiation of joy, such as "`eye has not seen,
nor ear heard,
neither has it entered into the heart of man to conceive,`" which the
drinking of this water of life bestows upon the recipient of it.
What, to such a one, are the doubts, the scoffs,
and the questionings of his condition which the worldling may put forth?
"`_He,_`" certainly, "`knows of no such visitation from on high!`"
It would be strange if he did.
God does not cast his pearls before swine.
There must be "`a preparation of heart which is of the Lord,`"
before it is made fit for the reception of such favours,
a preparation of trial and discipline which worldlings disown and detest,
and put as far away from them as possible.
Yet, they consider themselves quite competent to judge such things
as the divine communications of God`'s Holy Spirit!

=== We know that all things work together for good, to them that love God. Romans 8:28

On this blessed word, the soul, in every trial, should calmly lay itself down to rest;
and on it, if it be indeed taught of God, it cannot _but_ rest.
Quite impossible is it for anyone,
whose measure of experience enables him to look back
through the lengthened vista of many years,
not to see that "`all the paths of the Lord have been mercy and truth to him;`" and
that in every passage of his life he has seen things working together for his good.
O, how sacred and sublime are those times, when,
retired from the noise and tumult of earthly hopes and fears, the aged,
and the deeply exercised servant of the Lord,
reviews the occasions in which the circumstances of his
lot have been all made to work together for his good!
How the heart, at such seasons,
goes forth in praise and adoration of Him who "`leads Joseph like a flock!`"
Truly, such have "`a song as in the night, when a holy solemnity is kept!`"

=== Study to be quiet. 1 Thess. 4:11

This is an inestimable lesson to learn; and one that we can never study too long,
or too deeply.

But O,
the intense opposition that it meets with in the strength and restlessness of the will!

You behold me, my Creator, my Holy One,
you see me bewildered in the mysterious depths of my own disordered nature:
you know the strife, the clamour, the confusion,
which my intense sensibility to pain and grief produce within me:
yet in the midst of the tempest, you command me to "`_be still._`"
O my Father, you would not command impossibilities.
"`I know, O Lord, that your judgments are right;
and that you in faithfulness have afflicted me.`"
It is with me that the hindrance lies.
It is in this restless, this childish,
but most imperious will that struggles to escape the yoke,
the wise restraining yoke of sorrow which you see fit to put upon it.
But you can subdue its violence.
I lay it low before you, beseeching you to chastise and keep it in the dust,
while I study to be quiet according to _your_ will.

=== Commit your works unto the Lord; and your thoughts shall be established. Proverbs 16:3

Whoever sets himself for the space of a quarter of an hour,
to the task of observing the motions of his own mind,
will comprehend the necessity of resorting to better strength than his own,
to regulate and control them.
Few persons consider this matter with the attention it requires.
The immense importance of the nature of the thoughts which occupy the mind,
seems even with religious people to be overlooked.
"`I hate vain thoughts,`" says David; "`but your law do I love.`"
Now, it is in observing the current in which the thoughts habitually run,
that we advance in the spiritual or the fleshly life.
The apostle Paul _perceived_ "`a law in his members, warring against the law of his mind.`"
It is of vital importance to our growth in the life of truth,
that we should clearly _perceive_ what law rules in our interior nature.

=== When you pray, enter into your closet; and when you have shut your door, pray to your Father which is in secret; and your Father which sees in secret, shall reward you openly. Matthew 6:6

It is cowardly to shrink from testifying that we are on the Lord`'s side when
occasions distinctly call upon us for the manifestations of our religious principles;
but great care should be taken that nothing of ostentation,
none of the Pharisee`'s "`desire to be seen of men,`" is
permitted to rise up and mar the purity of our zeal.
There is in all pure and genuine feeling, an innate delicacy which shrinks from display,
and which, by a holy instinct, seeks the covert of secrecy.
It is hardly to be conceived the mischief that is done to
young and sensitive minds on the subject of religion,
by the obtrusive, coarse, and perhaps, we may almost say,
disgusting efforts on the part of rough-minded persons to recommend it to their notice.
It is a beautiful thought in one of the poems of Keats:

=== Then shall you say in your heart, who has begotten me these, seeing I have lost my children, and am desolate; a captive and wandering to and fro? And who has brought up these? Behold I was left alone; these, where had they been? Isaiah 49:21

It has been credibly related in more than one instance,
that persons who have been rescued from drowning,
have said that the last sensibility they were conscious of,
presented them with a sight of the past events and circumstances of their whole lives,
and that in the glance of a moment.

It seems far from improbable, that thus beholding at one view as in a picture,
the _reality_ of what we have been doing, and its value or worthlessness,
may constitute a part of the bliss or woe that will
seal our transit to another state of being.
"`Hell is truth seen too late,`" is the remark of an old divine;
and Heaven may be truth seen in due season.
What can we conceive of greater joy than to find restored to us every act of goodness,
long forgotten it may be by us,
but treasured for us by the love and goodness of God in His heavenly garner?
Then may the grateful question arise, "`who has begotten me these?
Behold, I was left alone; these, where had they been?`"
They had been with God, dear soul, their owner.

=== The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit; a broken and a contrite heart, O God, you will not despise. Psalm 51:17

While there is any tenderness left in the heart,
there is something in the worst of sinners for the nature of God to unite with.
The only entirely hopeless case is, when pride hardens the heart, and it resists,
instead of yielding to, the goodness that would lead it to repentance.

It is certain that many persons not only settle down in this fearful hardness,
but actually pride themselves for possessing it.
"`They are no whimperers,`" they say; "`they put their shoulder to the wheel,
and _work_ themselves out of their difficulties.`"
The working, instead of lamenting, nobody ought to find fault with: but unhappily,
this diligence in doing is too often substituted
as something better and wiser than feeling.

The earthly nature must be broken by repentance,
before it can work according to the will of God;
and then perhaps it will learn that the duty of what
it calls "`_whimpering,_`" or in more decent language,
weeping for sin, is the first work that God calls for at its hands.

=== Stand in awe, and sin not; commune with your own heart upon your bed, and be still. Psalm 4:4

It is quite essential to happiness that we should
be sensible of a stand-point within our minds;
a home, a dwelling place, for the Spirit.
Here are some concise, but comprehensive counsels,
well fitted to guide us into the ark of refuge we need.
"`Stand in awe, and sin not.`"
Be deeply reverent, and most reverent in solitude, of the presence of the Spirit of God;
which is "`about your path, and about your bed, and spies out all your ways.`"
"`Commune with your own heart, upon your bed, and be still.`"
Keep hold of that which is so prone to wander,
and to be taken captive by wicked and disorderly spirits.
"`Commune`" with it; make diligent search into its desires and purposes; and silence,
with the authority of conscience, all that it presents to you of vanity and sin.
These are the sacrifices of righteousness; which, having been sincerely offered up,
then "`be still, and put your trust in the Lord.`"

=== Lead me in your truth, and teach me, for you are the God of my salvation, on you do I wait all the day. Psalm 25:5

To wait upon the Lord is a very different thing from what many persons take it to be.
It is not, as is commonly supposed,
an expression significant of any external religious exercise.
It means a specific act; the act of waiting,
which is quite another act from that of speaking, or reading, or praying with the lips.
It is an act of silent attention to what passes in the recesses of the mind,
and as such it demands observation of whatever arises there.
It requires a hushed stillness, a cessation of all the motions, thoughts,
and desires of the natural man; and a hearkening, that is,
a discernment of what rises up that is not of nature, but of grace.
It may be that you have tried it in a weak and superficial way,
and consequently have not even reaped the benefit of patience in the exercise;
but you can never have steadily persevered in this act of duty for any length of time,
without discovering the strength it possesses in assisting to reveal Truth.

=== This God is our God, forever and ever; he shall be our Guide even unto death. Psalm 48:14

No creature is so truly helpless as man,
though he stands at the head of the visible creation.
It is his power, his actual superiority to the animals he governs,
which occasions the poverty and desolation of his lot.
For, could he aspire no higher than they do,
or could he reasonably suppose that God and his own conscience
made no other claims upon him than upon them,
he might close his anxieties about the future, and think only of enjoying the present.
"`Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die,`" might then justifiably be his motto.
But however in his inferior nature he may wish to do so,
he cannot rest on this ignoble basis of belief.
He feels, by a holy instinct, that he belongs to God: and,
in so far as his nature is renewed to possess faith in this divine being,
he rejoices in the resolution of the Psalmist, and says with him, "`this God is my God,
forever and ever; he shall be my Guide even unto death.`"

=== I am feeble and sore broken: I have roared by reason of the disquietude of my heart. Lord, all my desire is before you; and my groaning is not hidden from you. Psalm 38:8-9

If the veil could be lifted which hides the sorrows under
which many human hearts are unsuspectedly suffering,
we should be overpowered with a view of the mournful condition of the world.
People cheat one another, and cheat themselves, with things that amuse the senses,
and beguile the time; but, in the midst of it all,
some bosom grief mocks at the futile attempts they make to escape from its grasp,
and in the secret of their souls,
how many thousands that seem to be happy are "`feeble and sore broken!`"
It is good to recognize, and to submit to this state of bruising and reproving,
whenever the Lord visits us with his stripes.
It is a sign that the medicine is acting for eternal benefit, when,
in these suffering times, the soul can truly say,
"`all my desire is before you;`" for never is this truly and penitentially said,
but some gleam of hope and comfort will visit the heart that gives utterance to it.

=== Oh that men would praise the Lord for his goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men. Psalm 107:8

Lack of faith, a heart wedded to the world, a hard,
proud disdain of being considered superstitious or fanatical, these, and such as these,
are the hindrance to the realization of the many
precious promises with which the Scriptures abound.
Well might the Psalmist again and again exclaim,
"`Oh that men would praise the Lord for his goodness,
and for his wonderful works to the children of men!`"

Alas that it should only be said in vain!
In a vague and general way indeed, men will praise the Lord for his goodness,
when things fall out according to their desires.
But the right testimony is given (and blessed be God that there are some who can,
and who do give it) when the soul from actual knowledge and experience
of the goodness of God in all his dealings with it,
and "`_most_ in the severe,`" can truly call upon itself, and every one of the human race,
to "`praise the Lord.`"
But there must be a large and divine acquaintance with the _nature_ of God,
before we are in a condition to use appropriately the language of thanksgiving.

=== Be not deceived; God is not mocked; for whatsoever a man sows, that shall he reap. For he that sows to his flesh, shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he that sows to the Spirit, shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting. Galatians 6:7-8

It is a striking testimony to the carnal mind as being "`enmity against God,`" that,
while every species of knowledge,
more particularly that which relates to science and the arts,
is at the present day sought with avidity,
the knowledge of divine truth remains just where it always was, hidden, despised,
and rejected.
There is, unquestionably, much more of head-knowledge with respect to religious doctrine,
than there was fifty years ago; but this is a different thing from the knowledge of God,
and of his truth.

_This_ is as little known as ever; yes, what if I should say,
that it is _less_ known than ever?
People will endure, they will even like, a certain kind and quantity of truth;
but not such truth as that embodied in these Scriptures.
Nevertheless, _this_ is the truth of God, that, "`whatsoever a man sows,
_that_ shall he reap.`"
Yes, this is an axiom as sure in morals as any of the truths of mathematics.

=== Deliver my soul from the sword; my darling from the power of the dog. Psalm 22:20

When, by obedience and faith, the believer has made some progress in the divine life,
he experiences a sensibility to its sweetness and value,
which is a feeling bestowed by God himself for its preservation.
This sentiment inspires him with a holy horror of sin.
He has an assured confidence that not only is he
the guardian of something precious to himself,
but precious also in the sight of God.
Hence, at the least approach of his spiritual foes, he starts up alarmed,
and calls upon his true Helper to aid him in the rescue of a life so choice
and sacred as that which the grace of God has given to him.
Nothing would be so terrible to him,
as to lose the sweet and tender visitations of the Most High, through unwatchfulness,
or by giving place for a moment, to the wild beasts of the animal nature.
Like one of old, he would say, "`my soul is among lions,
and I lie even among them that are set on fire.
Save me, O my God, from their destructions;
deliver my darling from the power of the dog.`"

=== The way of the Lord is strength to the upright. Proverbs 10:29

The way of the Lord is to be perceived in that interior
sense of truth which enlightens the conscience;
and which it is the utmost perversion of reason to slight or reject,
under the notion of its being merely a natural light.

Be it natural or supernatural,
it is that without which we should be wholly incapable of understanding truth,
or of receiving any spiritual instruction; for, in that case,
spiritual instruction might as well be addressed to the beasts of the field as to man.

The pure and holy way of the Lord,
crosses and corrects the impure and unholy way of the human being,
by smiting him with a secret consciousness of shame when he transgresses.
And it is this Reprover of evil which, when obeyed, gives moral strength,
and builds up the soul in a rectitude of principle that, like a fortress,
keeps it safe from all its foes.

Turn in then, you that would understand and partake of the security it bestows,
turn in to the secret chambers of your own heart,
and there watch how the Lord`'s way checks and regulates
all the disorders and confusion of your own way,
and gives you strength in giving you uprightness of heart.

This is an appeal, this is an exhortation,
which comes forth warm and living from the speaker`'s soul, and goes straight,
with life-giving power, to enliven the souls to which it addresses itself.

"`Dearly beloved and longed for!
My joy and crown!`"
What love, indeed,
can be compared to that which knits the hearts of God`'s children into unity with Him,
and through Him with one another!

O Father, our heavenly Father, help your own to love You!
And in loving You, to love each other also.
Help them to "`stand fast`" in You, the Rock of ages;
so that each one of them in their place and condition,
though they be unknown face to face, may feel that unity in each other, and in you,
in the stream of that blessed life which makes glad your city,

=== For the Lord takes pleasure in his people; he will beautify the meek with salvation. Psalm 149:4

This is the view of religion which cheers and refreshes,
and which gives an impetus to the life of God in the soul of man.
"`The Lord takes pleasure in His people.`"
No principle is so potent in operation with a mind that is in its right state,
as that of being a source of delight to a beloved object.
Can any stimulus to good conduct be so noble and so pure,
as the thought that the Lord should "`take pleasure`" in me?
And he is pleased with the soul which makes it a
pleasure to do what is acceptable in his sight.
He "`remembers all its offerings,
and accepts its burnt sacrifices;`" even when the
soul that rendered them has forgotten them.

It only remains that we strive to be "`meek and lowly
in heart,`" that we may be beautified with salvation,
and become a crown of glory in the hand of the Lord,
and a royal diadem in the hand of our God; not a grain of his gold can be lost,
nor one of his precious stones missing.

And oh, what blessed, what _real,_ what enduring things are these!
How sweet is their nature,

How they draw the mind away from all evil surmisings, all little, low,
vexatious quarrels with a fellow creature`'s infirmities.
With what innocent joy and rest they compose the soul,
and cause it to "`delight itself in the abundance of peace!`"
Love can do no harm to its neighbour, for it knows not the indulgence of an evil thought.
It "`rejoices not in iniquity, but rejoices in the truth.`"

Who shall bring us into this exalted state of being?
Even that Spirit which prompts the desire to experience it.

Nothing but Love can be immortal; for nothing but Love is perfect;
and all that is imperfect must die.
